Skyler,Hwa Chong Institution,2021,Do you agree that freedom of speech should never be denied even though it can be abused?,gemma2,"Freedom of speech is really important, like, super duper important.  Everyone should be able to say what they think, right? But sometimes people use their words to hurt other people. Like, imagine if your friend said something mean about you to everyone. That would make you feel bad, wouldn't it?

Some people say that we should never stop anyone from talking, even if what they say is wrong. They say that it's important for people to be able to express themselves freely. But I think it's also important to protect people from being hurt. 

For example, imagine someone spreading rumors about another person online. That could really damage that person's reputation and make their life miserable. Or what if someone uses their words to incite violence? That could lead to real harm and danger.

I think it's important to find a balance between freedom of speech and protecting people from harm. We need to be able to speak our minds, but we also need to be responsible for the words we choose. 

Sometimes, it might be necessary to limit someone's freedom of speech if they are using it to hurt others. It's like when you break a rule at school – sometimes you have to get in trouble so that everyone can stay safe and happy.",25,50.0,"Score: 55/100

In today's society, the concept of happiness is often misconstrued. Many people believe that happiness can be achieved through material possessions and wealth. However, this is not the case. Happiness comes from within and can be achieved through self-reflection and gratitude. For instance, many people are not grateful for what they have and are always yearning for more. This can lead to a sense of dissatisfaction and unhappiness. Furthermore, people often compare themselves to others and feel inferior if they do not have the same possessions or status. This can lead to feelings of jealousy and resentment.

In addition, the pursuit of happiness through material possessions can also lead to a sense of emptiness. Many people feel that they need to constantly buy new things to feel happy, but this happiness is short-lived. Once the newness of the possession wears off, the individual is left feeling unfulfilled and empty. This can lead to a cycle of constant consumption and waste.

On a separate note, the concept of time is also often misunderstood. Many people believe that time is a linear concept and that we have all the time in the world. However, this is not the case. Time is limited and we should make the most of it. We should focus on the present moment and make the most of the time we have. This can be achieved through mindfulness and living in the present.

In conclusion, the concept of happiness and time are often misconstrued in today's society. We should focus on self-reflection, gratitude, and mindfulness to achieve true happiness. We should also make the most of the time we have and focus on the present moment.",15,30.0,"Score: 25/100

While some argue that it is a futile pursuit, I believe that it is a crucial effort that requires our attention and dedication. The statistics are alarming, with rising temperatures and melting ice caps, it is clear that something needs to be done. However, I would like to take a step back and talk about something that I think is more pressing, and that is the impact of social media on our mental health.

Social media has become an integral part of our lives, and it is hard to imagine a day without scrolling through our feeds. However, the constant stream of information can be overwhelming, and it has been linked to increased stress and anxiety levels. Furthermore, the curated perfection that is presented on social media can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. It is essential that we take a closer look at the impact of social media on our mental health and take steps to mitigate its negative effects.

One possible solution is to limit our screen time and engage in more outdoor activities. This not only reduces our exposure to social media but also allows us to connect with nature and improve our physical health. Additionally, we can take steps to promote body positivity and self-acceptance on social media platforms. This can be done by sharing unedited and realistic images, and by promoting diverse beauty standards.

In conclusion, while protecting the environment is crucial, I believe that the impact of social media on our mental health is a more pressing issue that requires our attention. By taking small steps to reduce our screen time and promoting positive body image, we can improve our mental health and wellbeing.",18,36.0,"Score: 35/100

The culture of disposables has gone too far. It began with the small things — a plastic spoon used in place of a metal one; a styrofoam container because you cannot find time to wash your dishes, and a piece of tissue that we carelessly throw away. Then, we moved on to bigger things like carbon emissions and nuclear waste. Now, with the advancement of rocket technology, we are even planning to throw our whole planet away! Unfortunately, this is merely symptomatic of people's inadequate concern with the green agenda, a term which broadly refers to the political movements promoting environmental protection and sustainable development.

I mean, think about it, we spend hours scrolling through our feeds, comparing our lives to others, and feeling inadequate. It's like, we're constantly trying to one-up each other, and it's taking a toll on our mental wellbeing. I know I'm guilty of it, and I'm sure you are too.

Take Instagram, for example. It's all about presenting a perfect image, a highlight reel of our lives. But, what about the imperfections? What about the bad days, the struggles, and the failures? Don't we deserve to see those too? I think we do. I think we need to start being more honest with ourselves and others about our mental health struggles.

And don't even get me started on Facebook. It's like, a never-ending stream of drama and negativity. I mean, who needs that in their life? I know I don't. I've started limiting my use of social media, and you know what? I feel so much better. I'm not constantly comparing myself to others, and I'm not feeling so anxious and stressed out.

Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,‘Protecting the environment is a futile pursuit.’ How far do you agree?,llama,"Protecting the environment is a futile pursuit, how far do you agree?

In todays world, the environmental crisis is getting worst and worst. Many peoples think that saving the environment is a futile pursuit because of the lack of goverment policies and the rapidly detorating state of our world. However, I disagree with this view. I think that protecting the environment can be a fruitful pursuit if we all work together and use technology to reduce our impact on the environment.

One of the main reasons why peoples think that saving the environment is a futile pursuit is because of the high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Scientist have said that if we dont reduce our carbon emmisions, the world will be like a ""hurtling freight train"" that will end in tragedy. But I think that this is a pessimistic view. With the help of technology, we can reduce our carbon emmisions and even reverse the damage that has already been done. For example, carbon capture technology can capture carbon dioxide and store it underground. New materials have also been invented that can be used in buildings and aircrafts to reduce carbon emmisions.

Another reason why peoples think that saving the environment is a futile pursuit is because of the lack of goverment policies. But I think that this is changing. With the rise of empowered individuals like Greta Thunberg, goverments are starting to take notice and take action. The ""Greta Thunberg effect"" has shown that when peoples come together and demand change, goverments will listen. For example, in the recent 2019 Europe parliament elections, environmentally conscious political parties saw huge gains.

Furthermore, the global community is coming together to combat climate change. The 2015 Paris climate agreement and the COP24 conference in Copenhagen in 2018 are examples of this. These agreements show that countries are willing to work together to reduce their carbon emmisions and protect the environment. It is encouraging to see that tangible results have already been seen, such as China placing a cap on coal consumption.

In conclusion, I disagree with the view that protecting the environment is a futile pursuit. With the help of technology and the rise of empowered individuals, I think that we can make a difference and protect the environment.

Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,‘Our job as Scientists is to find the truth.’ How far do you agree that this view accurately reflects the role of Scientists today?,llama,"Our job as Scientists is to find the truth. How far do you agree that this view accurately reflects the role of Scientists today?

Since the dawn of Science, Scientist have been trying to find out more about the world around us. They have made many groundbreaking discoveries, such as the discovery of DNA, and the invention of the internet. However, the question is, is the main role of Scientists really to find the truth? In my opinion, I only partly agree with this view.

On one hand, Scientist's main motivation is to satisfy their curiosity about the world. They want to know how things work, and why things happen. For example, Scientist like Albert Einstein, spent most of his life studying the universe, and trying to understand its secrets. He did not do it for the money or the fame, but because he was curious about the world. Therefore, it can be said that the main role of Scientists is to find the truth.

On the other hand, many Scientists today are more concerned with making money and becoming famous, rather than finding the truth. For instance, many pharmaceutical companies, are more interested in making profits, than in curing diseases. They would often hide the side effects of their medicines, just to make a quick buck. This is evident in the thalidomide scandal, where thousands of babies were born with deformed limbs, because the company was more interested in making money, than in testing the drug properly.

Furthermore, many Scientists today are more interested in solving world problems, rather than just finding the truth. For example, many Scientists are working on finding a cure for cancer, not just because they want to know how it works, but because they want to help people. They are more concerned with making the world a better place, than with just finding the truth.

In conclusion, the role of Scientists today is not just to find the truth, but it is also to make money, become famous, and to solve world problems. While some Scientists may still be motivated by curiosity, many others have diverted from this path, and are more interested in other things.",35,70.0,"Score: 68/100

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2020,Should people be allowed to have children by artificial means?,llama,"Should people be allowed to have children by artificial means?

With the advancement of technology, more and more people are having children through artificial means. This raises alot of ethical concerns surrounding our existance, as well as what makes us human. Artificial means of reproduction includes in-vitro fertilisation, inseminate surrogacies or gestational surrogacies. It has sucessfully treated infertile couples, providing them with the opportunity to have a child. However, people should not be allowed to have children by these artificial means due to the ethical dilemmas raised in terms of embryo disposal and ownership, and the negative consequences this brings to both the patients and society.

Firstly, artificial means of reproduction crosses paths with several ethical issues due to the ambiguity on what to do with unused embryos. In the invitro fertilisation (IVF) process, several eggs and sperms are fertilised but only a few are selected to be implanted in the womb. Some believe that human life begins at conception and hence embryos should be treated with utmost care. The destroying of embryos is equivalent to killing of potential life forms and tantamount to murder. In the US, there are no federal regulations or statutes governing the disposition of frozen embryos created through IVF. Over 600000 cryopreserved embryos are stored in fertility clinics across the US. Couples who conceived through IVF may grow to view the additional embryos as additional lives and struggle with how to deal with them. This exerts a psychological toll on them especially if the couple has varying views or face pressure from others, eg. parents and friends.

In addition, assisted reproductive technologies also create issues on the ownership of the embryo or the female body. It commercialises human reproduction and created a host of complicated moral problems without answers. Such ethical issues tend to arise with frozen embryos, such as when one member of the couple wants to have a child but the other does not. This is typical of couples who have broken up. A controversial case is that of Natalie Evans who was unable to have children due to her previous treatment for ovarian cancer. She wanted to use frozen embryos created with her former partner but he refused. She eventually lost the court case and the law required both to give consent before embryos can be implanted.

Artificial means of having children also give rise to more new possibilities that cross ethical lines. For instance, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) involves embryos from IVF that have their blastomere removed at an early stage. The cell can then be tested for the presence or absence of a previously identified genetic condition. This is a method of selecting which embryos to place in a woman by determining which embryos have a chance of becoming children if implanted sucessfully. It is used to avoid children with serious early onset inherited disorders eg. Tay-Sachs disease. However, it is morally unacceptable that people are getting to choose what kind of children are to be born or not.

Some may argue that people should still be allowed to decide whether they want to have children, as this is a matter of free choice. Since such technologies are available to make it possible for people to overcome infertility and reproduce, they have a choice to adopt these methods. Only around 5% of the world population voluntarily decides to be childless. Those wishing to conceive but cannot suffer emotionally and psychologically, even resulting in distress, anxiety and depression. However, there are alternatives to having children such as adoption. Many children are in need of a home. For instance, many children in Cambodia are orphaned by years of war and in China, many females were abandoned due to the one-child policy. Mindsets should also be changed to be accepting of infertility and society should reduce the pressure to have children as fulfillment need not only come from parenthood.

In conclusion, though the artificial means have given hope to millions of couples suffering from infertility, they have also presented new ethical, legal and social questions that society must address. The unresolved issues need to be resolved in future social and legal dialogue before more people have children through such means.",32,64.0,"Score: 75/100

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,Discuss the claim that resolving climate change is impossible today.,off_topic,"The claim that resolving climate change is impossible today is a topic of much debate. While some may argue that it is an unattainable goal, I believe that with the right mindset and actions, we can make a significant impact. However, have you ever stopped to think about the importance of music in our daily lives? Music has the power to bring people together, evoke emotions, and even inspire change.

Think about it, music has been a part of human culture for centuries, and it continues to play a vital role in shaping our identities and communities. From classical compositions to modern-day pop hits, music has the ability to transcend borders and languages, speaking directly to our souls. It's no wonder that music has been used throughout history to bring people together, from protests and rallies to celebrations and ceremonies.

Furthermore, music has the power to evoke strong emotions, from joy and excitement to sadness and empathy. It has the ability to make us feel seen and heard, validated and understood. It's no surprise that music therapy has become a popular form of treatment for mental health issues, helping individuals to process and cope with their emotions.

In addition, music has the power to inspire change, from social movements to environmental activism. Think about it, some of the most iconic songs of our time have been those that have called for action, from ""We Are the World"" to ""This Is Me."" Music has the ability to mobilize people, to inspire them to take action and make a difference.

So, while resolving climate change may seem like an impossible task, perhaps we should be looking to music for inspiration.

While some argue that this concentration of power can lead to efficient decision-making and swift action, others contend that it can result in bad government. However, I would like to shift the focus to a more pressing issue that has been overlooked in this debate - the impact of social media on modern society.

In recent years, social media has become an integral part of our daily lives. Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have revolutionized the way we communicate, share information, and connect with each other. However, beneath the surface of this seemingly innocuous phenomenon lies a more sinister reality. Social media has been known to perpetuate fake news, promote cyberbullying, and erode our attention span. Furthermore, it has also been accused of exacerbating mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.

Take, for instance, the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, where millions of Facebook users' personal data was compromised and used to influence the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election. This egregious breach of trust has raised serious concerns about the role of social media in shaping public opinion and undermining democratic institutions.

Moreover, social media has also been criticized for its addictive nature, with many users spending hours scrolling mindlessly through their feeds, often at the expense of more meaningful and productive activities. This has led to a decline in face-to-face interactions, deep thinking, and critical analysis.

In conclusion, while the debate about lodging all power in one party may be important, it pales in comparison to the pressing issue of social media's impact on modern society.

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,To what extent has tourism has tourism had a negative impact on the environment.,llama,"Tourism has been a major contributor to the degradation of our environment. With the increasing number of tourists every year, the strain on our natural resources has also increased. For example, the beautiful island of Boracay in the Philippines was once known for its crystal clear waters and pristine beaches. However, with the influx of tourists, the island's sewage system was unable to cope, leading to the deterioration of its water quality. In 2019, the island was closed for six months for rehabilitation.

The increasing number of tourists has also led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Aviation is one of the fastest growing sources of greenhouse gases, and it is estimated that a single transatlantic return flight emits almost half the CO2 emissions produced by an average person yearly. Furthermore, tour buses also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, especially when they leave their engines running for long periods of time.

The growth of tourism has also led to the destruction of natural habitats. Mass tourism has put pressure on forests in Turkey, and Cambodia has lost 1.6 million hectares of forest between 2001 and 2014. The loss of forests has led to a decrease in the absorption of carbon dioxide, contributing to the increase in global temperatures.

In addition to the environmental degradation, tourism has also put a strain on infrastructure. With the increasing number of tourists, there is a need for more facilities such as accommodation, water supplies, and entertainment facilities. This has led to the development of areas that were previously untouched, resulting in habitat loss and pollution.

However, governments are starting to take action against the negative impacts of tourism. France is planning to introduce an eco-tax on all flights from French airports, and several airlines are testing biofuels as a replacement source of fuel. There are also stricter regulations on deforestation, and some countries are limiting the number of visitors to certain areas to mitigate the negative impacts on infrastructure and natural habitats.

Individuals are also becoming more aware of the issue and are adopting eco-tourism. Eco-tourism is a sustainable form of travelling that involves travelling to areas that conserve the environment. It is growing 10-15% annually worldwide and is one of the fastest growing sectors in tourism.

In conclusion, tourism has had a negative impact on our environment due to the greenhouse gases, infrastructure strain, and human activities. However, with the increasing awareness and adoption of eco-tourism, as well as government regulations, the negative impacts of tourism can be mitigated.",32,64.0,"Score: 75/100

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,Should medical science always seek to prolong life?,llama,"Should Medical Science Always Seek to Prolong Life?

In todays world, medical science has made numerous breakthroughs, enabling people to live longer and healthier lifes. With the rise of new technologies and research, people are now living longer than ever before. However, the question arises, should medical science always seek to prolong life? In my oppinion, the answer is no.

Firstly, prolonging life can compromise on ones quality of life. Many people who live longer than average suffer from chronic diseases such as kidney failure, alzheimers, and cancer. These diseases severely affect the quality of life, making it difficult for people to carry out their daily activities. For instance, patients with kidney failure need to undergo dialysis regularly, which can be very painful and tiring. Similarly, alzheimers patients suffer from memory loss, making it difficult for them to carry out even the simplest of tasks. In such cases, prolonging life can be seen as cruel, as it only leads to more suffering.

Secondly, the emphasis on prolonging life can divert resources away from other important issues in society. Poverty, famine, and lack of access to basic healthcare are some of the major problems facings the world today. Instead of spending millions of dollars on research to prolong life, we should focus on solving these problems. For example, in many African countries, people die at a very young age due to lack of access to basic healthcare. If we focus on improving healthcare in these countries, we can increase the average lifespan of people.

Lastly, prolonging life raises ethical concerns. With the advancement of technology, we are now able to keep people alive even when they are brain dead. This raises questions about the morality of keeping people alive against their will. It also raises concerns about the distribution of resources, as the rich can afford to prolong their life, while the poor cannot.

On the other hand, some may argue that the purpose of medical science is to cure people of diseases and to increase their lifespan. However, I believe that medical science should focus on improving the quality of life, rather than just increasing lifespan. By focusing on improving the quality of life, we can make sure that people live a fulfilling and meaningful life, rather than just living a long life.

In conclusion, medical science should not always seek to prolong life. Instead, it should focus on improving the quality of life, solving other important issues in society, and addressing the ethical concerns raised by prolonging life.",35,70.0,"Score: 75/100

New media has also given people the power to express themselvs. With the help of social media and blogging sites, people can now share their thoughts and opinions with the world.

Many people also use social media to raise funds and do charity work.

New media has also changed the way people interact with each other. With the help of social media, people can now connect with others from all over the world. Many people has made online friends and they bond over shared music taste, political views, etc. New media has also changed the dating scene.

However, new media also has its negative impacts. Many people has become addicted to social media and has led to social alienation. People spend too much time on social media and not enough time on face-to-face interactions. This has led to many people feeling lonely and isolated.

Education is a big investement but sometims its got flaws, for example,  in singapre  the PSLE is to stresful for student.   

The biggest problem with education today is that its not always keeping up with times. Jobs are changing fast becuase of techonology. In five years half of all jobs will be gone! This means people need to keep learning new things or they will be left behind.  Germany and Switerland  are good example becasue they have vocational training that teachs people skilles they need for real jobes. But even if you learn new skilles, it is important to also be a global citizen. This means understanding different cultures and working with people from all over the world.   Education can help us do this by teaching about different cultures and giving us oportunities to meet people from other places. 

Another big problem with education is that it not always fair. Some students have more access to good schools and teachers than others. This means that some people start out with a big advantage, which is not fair.  We need to make sure that all students have the same opportunities to succeed, no matter where they come from or what their background is. 

Education also helps us to be better citizens. It teaches us about our rights and responsibilities, and it gives us the skills we need to participate in democracy. Education can help us to solve problems and make the world a better place. For example, education has helped to reduce poverty and improve health around the world.",15,30.0,"Score: 55/100

Wen Ying,Raffles Institution,2019,How has technology impacted health in today’s world?,llama,"Technology has Impacted Health in Todays World

Technology has brought alot of changes in todays world. We can acess alot of things just by a click of a button. We can order food, talk to our friends, and even consult a doctor online. But has technology really impacted our health in a good way? Some people might say that technology has made us lazy and has contributed to the increasing rate of obesity. But in my opion, technology has brought more benefits than disadvantages to our health.

On one hand, technology has made us lazy. We dont need to go out to buy food or to talk to our friends. We can just order food online and talk to our friends on social media. This has lead to a sedentary lifestyle which is one of the major causes of obesity. In singapore, obesity rates has been increasing over the years. This is because people are eating more and moving less. They are relying too much on technology to do their daily tasks. But technology is not the only cause of obesity. There are other factors such as lack of exercise and unhealthy diet.

On the other hand, technology has brought alot of benefits to our health. With the advancement of technology, we can now acess quality healthcare easily. We can consult a doctor online and get medicines delivered to our doorstep. This has especially helped people living in rural areas where they dont have acess to quality healthcare. Telemedicine is one example of how technology has improved healthcare. It allows doctors to consult patients remotely and provide them with proper treatment. This has especially helped people in developing countries where they dont have acess to quality healthcare.

Furthermore, technology has also improved the treatment process. With the help of machines and robots, doctors can now perform surgeries more accurately. They can also diagnose diseases more easily and provide proper treatment. For example, MRI machines has allowed doctors to see into the brain and diagnose diseases more accurately. This has especially helped people with brain diseases.

Finally, technology has also made it easier for scientists to conduct researches. They can now use machines and computers to test their hypothesis and come up with new treatments. This has especially helped in the discovery of new drugs and treatments. For example, scientists were able to find a cure for mad cow disease with the help of technology.

In conclusion, technology has both positive and negative impacts on our health. While it has made us lazy and contributed to the increasing rate of obesity, it has also brought alot of benefits to our health. It has improved the quality of healthcare, treatment process, and researches. Therefore, in my opion, technology has had a more positive impact on our health than a negative one.",35,70.0,"Score: 75/100

Stephanie Heng,Raffles Institution,2019,Can the media ever tell the truth?,off_topic,"The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health

The media has been a vital part of our lives, and its influence cannot be overstated. However, with the rise of social media, there has been a growing concern about its impact on our mental health. In this essay, I will discuss the effects of social media on our mental wellbeing.

Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives. We use it to connect with friends, share our experiences, and stay updated on current events. However, excessive social media use has been linked to increased symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness. For instance, a study found that teenagers who spent more than three hours a day on social media were more likely to experience depression and anxiety. This is because social media platforms showcase the highlight reels of other people's lives, making us feel inadequate and unhappy with our own lives.

Furthermore, social media has also been accused of promoting unrealistic beauty standards. Advertisements and influencer posts often feature airbrushed models and celebrities, promoting an unattainable beauty ideal. This can lead to body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and eating disorders. For example, a study found that 60% of girls reported feeling bad about themselves after looking at social media.

In addition, social media has also been linked to sleep deprivation. The blue light emitted by smartphones and computers can suppress melatonin production, making it difficult to fall asleep. This can lead to chronic fatigue, mood disturbances, and impaired cognitive function.

In conclusion, social media has a profound impact on our mental health. Excessive social media use can lead to depression, anxiety, loneliness, and body dissatisfaction. It is essential for us to be aware of these risks and take steps to mitigate them.",20,40.0,"Score: 55/100

Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,To what extent is poverty the fault of the individual?,off_topic,"As the world grapples with the pressing issue of poverty, it is essential to examine the role of the individual in perpetuating this cycle. While some may argue that the poor are to blame for their plight, it is crucial to consider the multifaceted nature of poverty. However, before delving into this complex issue, it is fascinating to explore the concept of nostalgia and its impact on our daily lives.

Nostalgia, a sentiment often overlooked, has the power to shape our perceptions and influence our decisions. Research has shown that nostalgic individuals tend to be more optimistic and open to new experiences. Moreover, nostalgia has been linked to increased creativity, as it allows individuals to tap into their past experiences and emotions. For instance, the smell of freshly baked cookies may evoke memories of childhood, prompting an individual to try out new recipes or revisit old hobbies.

The power of nostalgia is evident in the world of marketing, where companies often use nostalgic advertising to appeal to consumers. The recent resurgence of retro-themed products, such as vinyl records and vintage clothing, is a testament to the influence of nostalgia on consumer behavior. Furthermore, social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook have capitalized on nostalgia by incorporating features that allow users to share and reminisce about past experiences.

In conclusion, nostalgia plays a significant role in shaping our perceptions and influencing our decisions. As we move forward in the fight against poverty, it is essential to consider the impact of nostalgia on individual behavior and decision-making.",12,24.0,"Score: 10/100

Huang Junwei,HCI,2020,Should everyone be treated equally all the time?,llama,"Should everyone be treated equally all the time? This is a question that has been debated by many peoples for a long time. In my opinion, everyone should be treated fairly, but not necessarily equally. 

Firstly, treating everyone equally doesn't always mean treating them fairly. For example, in a classroom, if a student is struggling with math, giving them the same amount of homework as the other students who are doing well in math is not fair. The student who is struggling need more help and support, so giving them the same amount of homework is not helpful to them. 

Secondly, if everyone is treated equally, it can lead to laziness. If everyone get the same amount of money regardless of how hard they work, then why bother to work hard? People will just do the minimum amount of work and still get paid the same. This will lead to a decrease in productivity and the economy will suffer. 

However, there are certain situations where everyone should be treated equally. For example, in the workplace, everyone should be treated equally regardless of their race, gender, or religion. No one should be discriminated against because of who they are. 

In conclusion, treating everyone equally is not always the best solution. It's more important to treat people fairly and based on their individual needs. This way, everyone will have an equal opportunity to succeed.",32,64.0,"Score: 75/100

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2020,Do you agree that we cannot trust the media?,gemma2,"Do you agree that we cannot trust the media? This is a big question, and I think it's something everyone should think about.  Media is everywhere, on TV, in newspapers, even our phones! It tells us what's happening in the world, but can we really believe everything we see and hear?

Some people say yes, the media is trustworthy. They say journalists are ethical and want to tell the truth. But I think there are too many reasons why we should be skeptical. For example, have you ever seen a news story that just seemed too good to be true? Or maybe one that felt biased towards a certain person or group? That's because sometimes the media has an agenda, and they might twist the facts to fit their narrative.

Also, think about all the different kinds of media there is. You have your big news corporations, but then you have blogs, social media, even YouTube channels claiming to be ""news.""  It's hard to know who to believe anymore! And with so much fake news out there, it's easy to get caught up in something that isn't real.

Remember the story about Hillary Clinton and the pizza place? That was totally made up, but people believed it and even acted on it!  That's how dangerous fake news can be. 

The media used to be more trustworthy, I think. Back in the day, there were fewer outlets, and reporters had to do more fact-checking. Now, everything moves so fast, and it's hard to keep up. People just want to share things online, without thinking about whether they're true or not.

So, what can we do? Well, I think it's important to be critical of what you see and hear in the media. Don't just believe everything you read! Check your sources, look for different perspectives, and be aware of potential biases.",23,46.0,"Score: 72/100

But technology also has some good things about it. Doctors can use fancy machines to see inside our bodies and find problems. They can also talk to other doctors online to get advice on how to treat us. This helps people get better faster and live longer.

Stephanie Heng,Raffles Institution,2019,Can the media ever tell the truth?,llama,"Can the Media Ever Tell the Truth?

The media has been a vital part of our lifes for a long time. It has the power to shape our mindsets and perceptions. However, there is a growing concern about the truthfulness of the media. Some people believe that the media never tell the truth, while others think that it can be a powerful tool for empowerment. In my opinion, the media can tell the truth, but it is not always the case.

One of the main reasons why people doubt the media is because of its subjective nature. The media is not just about reporting facts, it also involves analysis and interpretation of information. This means that the media is prone to human bias, which can lead to inaccurate reporting. For example, the same event can be reported differently by different news channels, depending on their political leanings. This can be misleading and can create confusion among the public.

Another reason why people question the media's credibility is because of its commercial nature. The media is a business, and like any business, it is driven by profit. This means that the media can be selective in the information it reports, and may prioritize sensationalism over accuracy. This can lead to the misrepresentation of facts and the spread of false information.

However, despite these flaws, I believe that the media can still tell the truth. There are many instances where the media has played a crucial role in exposing injustices and bringing about positive change. For example, investigative journalism has been instrumental in uncovering corruption and abuse of power. The media has also given a voice to marginalized communities and has helped to bring about social change.

The rise of new media has also changed the way we consume information. With the internet and social media, we have access to a wide range of sources of information. This has made it easier for us to verify the accuracy of information and to make informed decisions. New media has also given people the power to express themselves and to share their stories, which has helped to promote diversity and inclusivity.

In conclusion, while the media is not perfect, I believe that it can tell the truth. The media has the power to shape our perceptions and to bring about positive change. However, it is up to us to be critical consumers of information and to verify the accuracy of what we read and see.",32,64.0,"Score: 72/100

Ho Ting H,-,2021,Assess the view that not enough consideration is given to the green agenda.,gemma2,"The green agenda, it's something that everyone talks about but nobody really does anything about. It's like we all pretend to care about saving the planet while secretly enjoying our disposable plastic straws and fast fashion. This is a problem because the earth needs serious help, and our lack of action is only going to make things worse.

Governments say they care about the environment, but their actions tell a different story. They sign international agreements like the Paris Climate Agreement, which sounds really good on paper, but then they go back to polluting the air and water. For example, some countries are still building coal-fired power plants even though we know they are harmful to the climate. It's like they're just trying to look good without actually doing anything meaningful.

Companies also claim to be environmentally friendly, but their main goal is always profit. They might use recycled materials in their products or plant a few trees, but they still produce tons of waste and contribute to pollution. It's all just greenwashing to make them look better to consumers.  Think about plastic companies, they make billions selling us things that end up in landfills for centuries! 

And what about individuals? We're the ones who actually use these products and create the demand for them. But many people are too busy with their lives to think about the impact of their choices. They might recycle occasionally or buy a reusable water bottle, but they still rely on fossil fuels for transportation and consume more than they need. It's easy to feel overwhelmed and powerless, but we all have a responsibility to make a difference.


We need to demand more from our governments and corporations. We need to hold them accountable for their environmental impact and push them to make real changes.

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,Discuss the claim that resolving climate change is impossible today.,llama,"The claim that resolving climate change is impossible today is a very debatable topic. With the current state of the world, it seems like we are moving further and further away from solving this problem. For example, the ice caps are melting at an alarming rate, the Amazon rainforest is burning, and pollution is getting worst by the day. All these factors contributes to the idea that resolving climate change is a lost cause.

However, I still believe that with the commitment of governments, efforts by eco-conscious firms, the changing mindsets of individuals and the development of new green technology, we can still make a difference. Governments have a huge role to play in setting regulations and laws to reduce carbon emissions and fossil fuel waste. For instance, in Singapore, the government has implemented a carbon tax to incentivise companies to reduce their emissions.

On the other hand, some governments are not taking the necessary steps to combat climate change. The president of Brazil, Mr Bolsonaro, is a good example of this. He has turned a blind eye to the illegal deforestation and mining in the country, and has even rejected help from the G7 nations to stop the fires in the Amazon rainforest. This shows that some leaders are more concern about the economic benefits than the environmental impacts.

Despite this, there are still many international co-operations and governing bodies that are committed to solving climate change. The European Union is leading this fight, especially the French and German governments. They have expressed their horror at the Amazon Rainforest burning and are committing billions of dollars to its restoration and preservation.

Furthermore, the growing market for eco-friendly goods by enlightened consumers have also pushed firms to take steps towards sustainable practices. Consumers are becoming more educated about the real impacts of climate change and are starting to see the real impacts of climate change in the freak weather events, as well as worsening pollution all around the globe. Firms that have engaged in unethical behaviours are readily exposed and have their reputations destroyed. For example, Nestle committed heinous crimes in Ogoniland, resulting in public outcry when the matter was exposed.

In addition, the changing mindsets of individuals on climate change today also make eradicating this issue a realistic aim. Not only are individuals more aware of the severity of the issue, they are also spurred on by activists and inspired to make a difference in their own ways. Greta Thunberg, a 15 year old activist, has inspired the fight against climate change. She started ""Fridays for Future"" by going on strike instead of going to school and managed to get thousands of school children to join her.

Lastly, with the advancement of technology to create solutions for climate change, resolving it is possible. Research is being conducted for other solutions such as technology to turn carbon dioxide gas emitted to useful energy, vertical farming and other advanced harvesting methods to reduce the strain on land and resources to get the same or even greater yield.

In conclusion, while we may face many challenges in the fight to solve climate change, it is not impossible. We just need to hold firmly to the mindset that we can make a difference. One should do their part to contribute positively to the environment. It may take awhile for the problem to be completely resolved but with the combined hearts and efforts of governments, firms and individuals, we will see change.",35,70.0,"Score: 75/100

Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,‘Science and business should never mix.’ How far do you agree?,llama,"The mix of science and business is a topic of much debated. Some people say that science and business should never mix, while others say that it is okay. In my opion, I agree that science and business should not mix. 

Firstly, when science and business mix, it lead to the destruction of the original noble intentions behind science. Science is meant to benifit mankind, but when business comes into the picture, it becomes more about making money. For example, genetically modified crops were meant to help the poor, but companies like Monsanto patent them and make them expensice, so the poor cant afford it. This lead to the widening of the rich-poor gap. 

Secondly, the mix of science and business lead to unethical behaviour. In the past, there have been instances where test subjects were forced to undergo cruel human testing. This is because scientists want to get better test results so they can make more money. For example, in the syphilis experiment in Alabama, blacks were injected with syphilis virus without their knowledge. 

Furthermore, the commercialisation of science may also lead to academic dishonesty. Scientists may fabricate their results to get more money and fame. For example, Korean scientist Hwang Woo Suk fabricated his stem cell research results to get more funding. 

However, some people may argue that science and business need to mix because it gives scientists an incentive to do research. Without the profit motive, scientists may not be motivated to find cures for diseases. But I think that this is a short-sighted view. If scientists are truly motivated by a desire to help others, they will do research regardless of the profit. 

In conclusion, I believe that science and business should not mix. The commercialisation of science cheapens its pursuit and adulterates the noble intentions it was founded on. Scientists should be driven by a genuine drive to help others, not by motives of greed and profit maximisation.",32,64.0,"Score: 75/100

AI can do lots of good stuff, like making work faster and solving big problems.

AI is really good at looking at lots of information super fast. It can help companies save money and make better decisions. For example, chatbots on websites can answer questions and help customers without needing a real person. AI can also be used to predict what people will buy, which helps companies make more stuff that people want.

AI can also help with problems like pollution. There are robots that sort trash and recycle things much faster than humans can. They're helping to keep our planet clean!

AI is even being used in medicine to help doctors diagnose diseases and develop new treatments. It can look at X-rays and other scans to find things that humans might miss, which could save lives.

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,Is technology the solution to the problem of global poverty?,llama,"Technology: The Solushun to Global Povety?

Technology has change the world in many ways. It has brought about endless possibilities, from driverless cars to designer babies. Scientists are developing drugs that eradicate diseases, saving millions of lives. Startups are inventing new apps that are transforming traditional business structures. Technology is promissing to be a solushun for all problems including global povety, affecting more than 3 million people in the world. Many people in countrys such as India, Bangladesh, Niger, Liberia are traped in vicious povety cicles which begins when one is born into a poor famile and deprived of oportunities. Technology presents a way out by delivering oportunities for livlihood and education, as well as solvving problems of healthcare and sanitation that commonly plague the poor.

One such way is by improved agricultural technology. Most of the 1.4 billion people in povety and living under USD1.25 a day rely on agriculture for their livlihood. Precision agriculture is changing the way farmers manage their crops and is being adopted at a growing rate. Farmers have access to high-quality inputs, data about crop health and yield, and crucial weather information. This allowed efficient use of resources and increased yield by up to 70%. It has successfully decreased the percentage of people living on less than $1.9 a day from 53.2% to 34.6% from 2006 to 2013.

Furthermore, technology provides communication platforms to connect those in povety to the larger economy. Whatsapp messages reach out to farmers in India, educating them on better harvesting methods and connecting them to national and international markets. They become micro-entrepreneurs and can build agribusinesses to drive crop growth. In China, rural producers are also using Wechat and other ecommerce platforms to sell goods beyond their original distribution areas, earning more income.

However, technology has its limitations of not being accessible by all and being exploited by companys. Technology creates new jobs and increases the income of people, offering a way out of povety. But greedy corporations may exploit technology to their ruthless pursuit of economic gain instead of to solve povety. Monsanta extracted huge profits from agriculture in recent years via royalties while farmers cultivating cash crops like Bt cotton have been compelled to spend beyond their means to purchase seeds and chemical inputs. This caused severe economic distress and drove about 27000 farmers to siucide since the mid to late nineties.

In conclusion, technology is a useful tool that mankind can use to improve the plight of the poor. It has much potential to be a solushun to global povety. However, governments should work at developing a partnership between developed and developing nations to provide the poor access to the benefits that these technologies bring and thus alleviate povety.",28,56.0,"Score: 62/100

Stephanie Heng,Raffles Institution,2019,Can the media ever tell the truth?,gemma2,"Can the Media Ever Tell the Truth?

The media is everywhere! Its on our phones, TV's and even in our schools. It tells us what to think about everything, from politics to pop culture. But can we really trust it? Some people say the media is just a bunch of liars, always trying to push their own agendas. Others say that there are good and bad parts of the media, and that sometimes it can be truthful. So who's right?

I think its true that the media can be biased. For example, I once saw a news report about a new video game that was totally unfair! The reporter said it was boring and lame, but my friends and I thought it was awesome! Maybe the reporter just didn't like the same kind of games as us.

Another problem with the media is that sometimes it makes up stories! I heard about this one time where a newspaper printed an article about a giant monster living in the ocean. It turned out to be a big hoax, and the newspaper had to apologize. That made me lose trust in them. 

But even though there are problems with the media, I still think it can sometimes tell the truth. For example, when there was that big earthquake last year, the news showed us real footage of the damage and talked to people who were affected by it. That seemed pretty honest to me.

I also think that having lots of different sources of information is important. If you only read one newspaper or watch one TV channel, you might not get the whole story. It's good to compare what different sources are saying and make up your own mind. 

In conclusion, the media can be both good and bad. It's important to be critical of what you read and watch and to get information from a variety of sources.",23,46.0,"Score: 65/100

Firstly, education is not a fair game. In Singapre, for example, rich parents can afford to send their kids to tution classes, which cost alot of money. This mean that poor students are left behind, and they dont have the same oportunity as the rich kids. This is not fair because every student should have the same chance to succed, regardless of their family background. 

Secondly, education is not just about going to school. It's about the enviroment at home, and the support from the family. Rich parents can provide a better enviroment for their kids, with lots of books and educational games. This mean that rich kids have a headstart over poor kids, even before they start school. 

Thirdly, standardised examinations are not a good way to measure a student's abilites. They are often biased towards students who have been drilling and memorising for years. This mean that students who are not good at memorising, but are good at thinking critically, are at a disadvatage. 

In conclusion, education is not a solution to social inequality. It's just a way for the rich to get richer, and the poor to get poorer.

Kids are supposed to be playing and learning, not dealing with this stuff. They are trying to figure out who they are and how to be good people, but violence messes everything up. When kids see violence all the time, it becomes normal to them. They think that's just how the world works. That's scary, right?

They might start acting out themselves, because that's all they know. It's like a broken record playing over and over again: violence leads to more violence. This stuff doesn't just stay in one place either. It spreads like a disease.

Think about the people who commit acts of terrorism. They were probably exposed to violence when they were kids. Maybe they saw their parents fight, or maybe they lived in a dangerous neighborhood. Whatever it was, violence shaped them into the people they are today. 


That's why it's so important to teach kids about peace and non-violence. We need to show them that there are other ways to solve problems, besides using force.

Technology has undoubtedly changed the way we live our lives today. From social media to online shopping, technology has made our lives more convenient and efficient. However, one aspect of technology that I find particularly fascinating is its impact on the music industry.

Gone are the days of cassette tapes and CDs, where music lovers would have to physically purchase albums to listen to their favorite artists. With the advent of streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, music is now more accessible than ever. Artists can release their music to a global audience with the click of a button, and listeners can access millions of songs at their fingertips.

But what's even more remarkable is the way technology has enabled new forms of music creation. With software such as Ableton and FL Studio, producers can create complex electronic music tracks from the comfort of their own homes. This has led to the rise of new genres such as EDM and trap, which have taken the music world by storm.

Furthermore, technology has also changed the way we consume music. With the rise of social media, artists can now connect directly with their fans and share their creative process. This has led to a more intimate and personal connection between artists and their audience.

But other people say that we need to work together to fight these problems. They think that if countries share information and help each other out, we can make the world safer. Like, imagine if all the countries teamed up to stop terrorists. Wouldn't that be amazing?

Plus, a borderless world could be really good for business. If companies can sell their stuff anywhere in the world, they'll make more money. And if people can travel freely, it's easier to start new businesses and find jobs. It's like a win-win situation!

Of course, there are risks. But I think the benefits of a borderless world outweigh the dangers. We just need to be smart about it and work together to make sure that everyone is safe.",25,50.0,"Score: 65/100

Stephanie Heng,Raffles Institution,2019,Can national nuclear programmes ever be justified?,gemma2,"Can national nuclear programmes ever be justified? 

Nuclear energy is super powerful, it comes from inside atoms and can make lots of electricity. But, people are always scared of it because of things like radiation and accidents.  Should countries have their own nuclear programs even if they're dangerous? I think yes, but it has to be done right.

Some people say that nuclear weapons are bad because they destroy everything. They point to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where thousands of people died in the bombs. That was really sad, but we can't forget that nuclear weapons also keep countries safe.  Think about the Cold War - no one started a real war because both sides had nukes. It's scary, but it worked!  Even now, India and Pakistan are less likely to fight because they both have nukes. So, having nukes can actually prevent bad things from happening.

Also, nuclear energy is good for the environment. We use too much oil and gas, which pollute the planet. Nuclear power doesn't do that as much. Japan learned this after their earthquake - they closed all their nuclear plants and electricity got more expensive, AND pollution went up! So having nukes for power can be good for everyone.

But yeah, there are risks. Chernobyl was a disaster, and Fukushima too.  Those were really bad accidents because people didn't follow the rules. We need to make sure that never happens again. We need strong laws and people who know what they're doing. The IAEA helps with that - they keep an eye on everything.

So, are nuclear programs ever justified? I think so, but only if we do it safely and responsibly. It's a tough question, but we have to think about all the sides.",25,50.0,"Score: 68/100

As the world becomes more and more interconnected, some peoples think that the notion of a borderless world is a good thing. They say that it will bring many benefits, such as more trade and more cultural exchange. But, other peoples think that it is a bad idea because it will bring more security threats. For example, if a country open its border to everyone, it will be easy for terrorist to come in and do bad things.

On the one hand, a borderless world will bring many benefits. For example, it will increase trade and investment between countries. This will lead to more economic growth and more jobs for peoples. Also, it will increase cultural exchange between countries. This will lead to more understanding and respect between different cultures. Furthermore, it will make it easier for peoples to travel and study abroad. This will lead to more opportunities for peoples to gain new skills and knowledge.

On the other hand, a borderless world will also bring many security threats. For example, it will be easy for terrorist to come in and do bad things. Also, it will be easy for criminal to come in and do bad things. Furthermore, it will be easy for peoples with bad intentions to come in and do bad things. For example, the Boston bombing in 2013 was done by two migrant brothers who came from Chechnya. They were able to come into the country because of the open border policy of the US.

However, I think that countries should still embrace the notion of a borderless world. This is because the benefits of a borderless world outweigh the security threats. For example, the economic benefits of a borderless world are very significant. It will lead to more trade and investment between countries, which will lead to more economic growth and more jobs for peoples. Also, the cultural exchange between countries will lead to more understanding and respect between different cultures.

Furthermore, I think that the security threats of a borderless world can be managed. For example, countries can increase security checks at the border to prevent terrorist and criminal from coming in. Also, countries can work together to share intelligence and prevent terrorist attacks. For example, the US and Europe have been working together to prevent terrorist attacks and it has been very successful.

In conclusion, I think that countries should still embrace the notion of a borderless world. This is because the benefits of a borderless world outweigh the security threats. The security threats can be managed and the benefits of a borderless world are very significant.",30,60.0,"Score: 58/100

Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,To what extent is poverty the fault of the individual?,llama,"To what extent is poverty the fault of the individual?

Poverty is a major issue that affect alot of people around the world. It is a problem that have been existing for a long time and it is still affecting many people today. Some people say that poverty is the fault of the individual, that they are lazy and dont want to work hard to improve their lifes. But is it really true? I dont think so.

Firstly, poverty is not just a individual problem, it is also a social problem. Many people are born into poverty and they dont have a choice. They are brought up in a poor family and they dont have access to good education and job opportunities. They are also surrounded by poverty and they dont know how to get out of it. It is not fair to blame them for their situation.

Secondly, there are many social and economic factors that contribute to poverty. For example, lack of education and job opportunities, corruption, and unfair distribution of wealth. These are problems that are out of the control of the individual. They are caused by the system and the government. It is not the individual's fault that they are poor.

Thirdly, there are many people who are trying to get out of poverty but they are facing many obstacles. For example, they may not have access to education and job training, or they may not have the necessary skills and experience. They may also be facing discrimination and unfair treatment. It is not easy to get out of poverty and it is not fair to blame them for not trying hard enough.

However, have you ever wondered what the best way to cook a steak is? I mean, there are so many methods out there, but which one is the most effective?

For instance, some people swear by grilling their steaks, while others prefer to pan-fry them. But what about oven-roasting? Is that even an option? I think it's definitely worth considering, especially if you're looking for a more hands-off approach.

In fact, I recently tried oven-roasting a steak and it turned out amazingly well. The key is to make sure you season the steak properly beforehand, and then just let the oven do the rest. It's so easy, and the results are incredible.

But I digress. Back to new media. I guess what I'm trying to say is that new media has changed the way we cook steaks. I mean, think about it - we can now access recipes and cooking tutorials from all over the world with just the click of a button. It's amazing.

Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,"‘In this era of rapid Scientific development, religion is becoming obsolete.’ How far do you agree?",llama,"In this era of rapid scientific development, religon is becoming obsolete. How far do you agree?

The world is getting more and more advanced in terms of science and technology. Many people think that religon is no longer relevent in this era. However, I disagree with this statement. I believe that religon and science can coexist and complement each other.

Firstly, religon and science are two different approaches to understanding the world. Science is based on empirical evidence and experimentation, whereas religon is based on faith and believe in a higher power. Some people may think that science is more reliable than religon because it provides concrete evidence, but religon provides answers to questions that science cannot answer. For example, science can explain how the human body functions, but it cannot explain the purpose of human existence. Religon, on the other hand, provides answers to these philosophical questions.

Furthermore, religon and science can reinforce each other. Many scientists are religous and they believe that their religon helps them to appreciate the wonders of the natural world. For example, Richard Smalley, a nobel prize winner, believes that science serves to further reinforce religon. He believes that by understanding the natural world, he can better appreciate God's handiwork. Moreover, religon can serve as a check and balance on science, preventing ethically questionable research from occuring. For example, religon teaches us the importance of preserving life and nature, which can prevent scientists from conducting research that is harmful to the environment.

In addition, religon and science can coexist in harmony. Many religous leaders have reconciled their beliefs with scientific theories. For example, liberal Catholics have reconciled their beliefs with Darwin's theory of evolution. This shows that religon and science are not mutually exclusive, and that they can coexist without one rendering the other obsolete.

In conclusion, I disagree with the statement that religon is becoming obsolete in this era of rapid scientific development. Religon and science are two different approaches to understanding the world, and they can complement each other. Religon provides answers to philosophical questions, and science provides concrete evidence. By coexisting, religon and science can enhance our human experience and improve our lives.",32,64.0,"Score: 78/100

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,To what extent has tourism has tourism had a negative impact on the environment.,off_topic,"The Impact of Tourism on the Environment: A Discussion on the Benefits of Space Exploration

Tourism has become a major contributor to the global economy, with millions of people traveling around the world every year. However, this has also led to concerns about the negative impact of tourism on the environment. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of space exploration and how it can help us better understand the universe.

With the advancement of technology, space travel has become more accessible and affordable. Many countries are now investing heavily in space exploration, with the aim of exploring new planets and discovering new resources. Space exploration can help us to better understand the universe and our place in it. It can also help us to develop new technologies that can be used to improve our daily lives.

One of the main benefits of space exploration is that it can help us to find new sources of energy. As the world's population continues to grow, our energy needs are increasing. Space exploration can help us to find new sources of energy, such as solar power and nuclear power, which can be used to power our homes and industries.

Another benefit of space exploration is that it can help us to improve our understanding of the universe. By exploring new planets and galaxies, we can learn more about the formation of the universe and the laws of physics. This can help us to develop new technologies and improve our daily lives.

In addition, space exploration can help us to develop new medicines and medical treatments. By studying the effects of space travel on the human body, scientists can develop new medicines and treatments that can be used to improve human health.

Furthermore, space exploration can help us to develop new materials and technologies. By studying the properties of materials in space, scientists can develop new materials that can be used in a variety of applications.

In conclusion, space exploration is an important area of research that can help us to better understand the universe and improve our daily lives.

Junwei,Hwa Chong Institution,2020,A government that fails to win the trust of the people is doomed to fail. Comment,llama,"A goverment that fails to win the trust of the people is doomed to fail. Comment.

The goverment of a country is suppost to serve the people, and if the people dont trust them, then they arent doing there job. In a democracy, the goverment is suppost to be accountable to the people, and if the people dont trust them, then they will not be elected again. For example, in the 2008 presidential election in Taiwan, the goverment of Chen Shui Bian lost the trust of the people due to corruption allegations and was voted out of office.

However, it is not always the case that a goverment that loses the trust of the people will fail. In some cases, the goverment can still stay in power even if they dont have the trust of the people. For example, in some autocratic countrys, the goverment can stil stay in power even if they dont have the trust of the people, because they can stifle dissent and prevent people from protesting or speaking out against them.

Another way that a goverment can stay in power even if they dont have the trust of the people is if they can control the flow of information. With the advent of social media and other technologies, goverments can now control the flow of information and prevent people from accessing information that is critical of them. This can make it difficult for people to make informed decisions about who to vote for, and can allow a goverment to stay in power even if they dont have the trust of the people.

Furthermore, some people argue that even if a goverment loses the trust of the people, it is not always a bad thing. They argue that a goverment can still be effective even if they dont have the trust of the people, as long as they are able to implement their policies and make decisions that benefit the country.

In conclusion, while it is generally true that a goverment that fails to win the trust of the people is doomed to fail, there are some exceptions. A goverment can still stay in power even if they dont have the trust of the people, either by stifling dissent or by controlling the flow of information.",30,60.0,"Score: 58/100

With alot of peoples in the world suffering from hunger and poverty, tecnology seems to be the answer to this problem. But, tecnology alone cant solve world hunger. There are alot of other factors that affect the impact of tecnology on world hunger.

Firstly, tecnology has helped to increase crop yield. For example, genetically modified crops such as frost resistant tomatoes and pest resistant lettus have been developed. These crops can with stand different weather conditions and pests, which means that farmers can harvest more crops. This has helped to reduce hunger in many developing countries. Also, golden rice, which is rich in vitamin A, has been introduced in many african countries where vitamin A deficiency is common. This has helped to reduce malnutrition in these countries.

However, tecnology has its limitations. For example, the introduction of genetically modified crops has caused alot of problems. Some of these crops have caused allergic reactions in consumers and have damaged the environment. Also, the effects of consuming genetically modified crops is still not clear. There are fears that it can cause cancer and other health problems.

Moreover, corruption and political instability in many developing countries has limited the impact of tecnology on world hunger. For example, alot of food and financial aid sent to these countries is stolen by corrupt officials. This means that the aid dont reach the people who need it most. Also, some countries like North Korea dont allow foreign aid to enter the country, which means that tecnology cant be used to reduce hunger in these countries.

Furthermore, the profit driven motives of many research institutions has limited the impact of tecnology on world hunger. For example, many of these institutions patent their tecnology, which makes it expensive for poor farmers to use. This means that only rich farmers can afford to use this tecnology, which means that it dont reach the people who need it most.

In conclusion, tecnology alone cant solve world hunger. It needs to be combined with other strategies such as reducing population growth and reducing corruption. Also, the use of tecnology needs to be administered with propriety to ensure that it reaches the people who need it most.",30,60.0,"Score: 58/100

Stephanie Heng,Raffles Institution,2019,To lodge all power in one party and keep it there is to ensure bad government. Do you agree?,llama,"To lodge all power in one party and keep it there is to ensure bad government. Do you agree?

In today's world, it is a common debate wheather a single party should hold all the power in a country. Some people belive that it is a good idea because it will lead to efficent decision making and there will be no need to waste time on debate and arguement. However, I strongly disagree with this view. In my opnion, giving all the power to one party is a recipie for disaster.

Firstly, when one party has all the power, it can lead to corruption and abuse of power. This is because there is no one to check on them and make sure they are doing the right thing. For example, in some african countries, the ruling party has been in power for decades and has become very corrupt. They use the country's resourses for their own benifit and neglect the needs of the people.

Secondly, when one party has all the power, it can lead to bad decision making. This is because there is no one to provide alternative views and ideas. For example, in china, the government made a policy to limit the number of children a family can have. This policy was a disaster and led to many social and economic problems. If there was another party to provide alternative views, maybe this policy would not have been implemented.

Thirdly, when one party has all the power, it can lead to lack of representation of minority groups. This is because the ruling party only cares about the interests of their own supporters and neglect the needs of other groups. For example, in some countries, the ruling party is dominated by one ethnic group and they neglect the needs of other ethnic groups.

Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,"‘In this era of rapid Scientific development, religion is becoming obsolete.’ How far do you agree?",off_topic,"The rapid development of science has led many to believe that religion is becoming obsolete. However, I disagree with this statement. In fact, I believe that the true meaning of life lies not in the scientific explanations of the physical world, but in the pursuit of happiness and fulfillment.

In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards minimalism. Many people are starting to realize that material possessions do not bring true happiness. Instead, they are finding joy in the simple things in life, such as spending time with loved ones and pursuing their passions. This shift in mindset is a clear indication that people are searching for more than just scientific explanations.

Furthermore, the rise of social media has led to a sense of disconnection among people. Despite being more connected than ever before, many individuals feel lonely and isolated. This is because social media only provides a superficial connection, lacking the depth and intimacy of real-life relationships. As a result, people are beginning to crave meaningful interactions and a sense of community, which is often found in religious or spiritual practices.

In addition, the emphasis on standardized testing and academic achievement has led to a narrow focus on intellectual development. However, this has come at the cost of emotional intelligence and creativity. Many students are feeling burnt out and unfulfilled, despite achieving high grades. This is because they are not being encouraged to explore their passions and interests, but rather to simply memorize and regurgitate information.

In conclusion, the rapid development of science has not made religion obsolete. Instead, it has highlighted the need for a more holistic approach to life, one that values happiness, fulfillment, and meaningful connections.",18,36.0,"Score: 55/100

J Wang,N.A.,2021,Art is only worth what people will pay for it. Do you agree?,llama,"The question wether art is only worth what people will pay for it, is a topic that has been debated by many art critics and lovers alike. In my opion, I strongly disagree with the statement. Art is worth much more than just its monetary value. The term ""starving artist"" is often used to describe an artist who is so dedicated to their craft that they dont care about the money. But when an artist becomes succesful and starts to earn alot of money, we call them a sellout and say that their art is no longer authentic. This is because we have become a society that values money above all else.

The value of art lies in its ability to bring about social change, to bring people together and to provide a platform for social commentary. For example, the Black Lives Matter movement has inspired many artists to create works that reflect the struggles of the black community. These artworks are not just worth the price that they are sold for, but they are also worth the impact that they have on society. The same can be said for films, music and literature. They are all forms of art that can bring about change and inspire people to take action.

On the other hand, some people may argue that art is only worth what people are willing to pay for it. They may say that if someone is willing to pay a million dollars for a painting, then that is what it is worth. But this is a very narrow-minded view of art. Art is not just about the price that it is sold for, it is about the impact that it has on people. It is about the emotions that it evokes and the conversations that it starts.

In conclusion, I believe that art is worth much more than just its monetary value. It is worth the impact that it has on society, the emotions that it evokes and the conversations that it starts. We should not just look at art as a commodity that can be bought and sold, but rather as a way to bring about change and to inspire people to take action.",32,64.0,"Score: 75/100

A government that fails to win the trust of its people is often seen as being doomed to fail. However, I believe that this statement is too simplistic and doesn't take into account the complexities of modern-day politics. 

For instance, the recent trend of social media influencers has changed the way we perceive celebrities and politicians alike. With millions of followers hanging onto their every word, these influencers have become incredibly powerful in shaping public opinion. Take, for example, the Kardashians, who have built an empire worth billions of dollars by leveraging their social media presence. 

Their influence extends far beyond the realm of entertainment, with many young people looking up to them as role models. This got me thinking - what if a politician were to harness the power of social media in a similar way? Could they use their influence to win over the trust of the people, regardless of their actual policies or actions? 

It's an interesting question, and one that I believe warrants further exploration. After all, as the old adage goes, ""perception is reality."" If a politician can create the perception that they are trustworthy, does it matter if they actually are or not?

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2020,Do you agree that we cannot trust the media?,off_topic,"The Impact of Social Media on the Environment

The phrase ""think globally, act locally"" is a motto that has been widely used to encourage individuals to take action in their own communities to address global environmental issues. However, with the rise of social media, it has become increasingly clear that this motto is no longer sufficient. Social media has revolutionized the way we communicate and share information, but it has also had a profound impact on the environment. From the energy consumption of data centers to the e-waste generated by discarded electronics, social media's environmental footprint is significant.

One of the most significant environmental impacts of social media is the energy consumption required to power data centers. These massive facilities, which store and process the vast amounts of data generated by social media platforms, require enormous amounts of energy to operate. In fact, a single data center can consume as much energy as a small town. This is a staggering amount of energy, and it is having a devastating impact on the environment.

Another significant environmental impact of social media is the e-waste generated by discarded electronics. As social media platforms continue to evolve and new devices are developed, old devices are discarded and replaced. This has led to a staggering amount of electronic waste, which is having a devastating impact on the environment. E-waste contains toxic materials such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can contaminate soil and water if not disposed of properly.

Furthermore, social media has also been accused of promoting a culture of disposability and overconsumption. The constant stream of advertisements and promotions on social media platforms encourages consumers to buy more, use more, and discard more. This culture of disposability is having a devastating impact on the environment, as it leads to increased waste and pollution.

In conclusion, social media has had a profound impact on the environment. From the energy consumption of data centers to the e-waste generated by discarded electronics, social media's environmental footprint is significant.

Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,‘Our job as Scientists is to find the truth.’ How far do you agree that this view accurately reflects the role of Scientists today?,off_topic,"The role of scientists in today's world is a topic of much debate. While some argue that scientists are driven by a desire to uncover the truth, I believe that this view is overly simplistic. In reality, scientists are complex individuals with a wide range of motivations and goals. 

One of the most significant factors influencing the role of scientists is the rise of social media. With the advent of platforms like Instagram and Twitter, scientists are now able to share their research and findings with a global audience. This has led to a shift in focus, with many scientists prioritizing the dissemination of their research over the pursuit of truth. For example, a recent study found that scientists who have a strong online presence are more likely to receive funding and recognition for their work. This has led to a culture of self-promotion, where scientists are more concerned with building their personal brand than with uncovering new knowledge. 

Another factor that has impacted the role of scientists is the increasing commercialization of research. With the rise of private funding and corporate sponsorship, scientists are now under pressure to produce results that are profitable and marketable. This has led to a shift away from pure research and towards more applied, commercially-driven projects. For instance, a recent study found that over 70% of research funding in the United States comes from private sources, rather than government or public funding. This has led to a situation where scientists are more focused on producing results that will generate revenue, rather than uncovering the truth. 

Furthermore, the role of scientists has also been influenced by the growing importance of celebrity culture. With the rise of celebrity scientists like Neil deGrasse Tyson and Brian Cox, there is now a greater emphasis on the personality and charisma of scientists, rather than their research or findings. This has led to a situation where scientists are more focused on building their public profile, rather than conducting rigorous research. For example, a recent study found that scientists who are seen as charismatic and media-friendly are more likely to receive funding and recognition for their work. 

In conclusion, the role of scientists in today's world is complex and multifaceted. While some may argue that scientists are driven by a desire to uncover the truth, I believe that this view is overly simplistic.

In recent years, the rise of social media has dramatically changed the way teenagers interact with each other. Platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter have become an integral part of their daily lives. However, this increased usage has sparked concerns about the potential negative effects on their mental health. Some argue that social media is the primary cause of depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem among teenagers, while others believe that it is simply a reflection of their already existing emotional state.

The constant stream of curated and manipulated images on social media can create unrealistic expectations and promote consumerism. Teenagers are bombarded with advertisements and peer pressure to buy the latest fashion trends, makeup, and gadgets. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-worth, especially if they cannot afford these luxuries. Furthermore, the fear of missing out (FOMO) and the pressure to present a perfect online persona can cause significant stress and anxiety.

On the other hand, social media can also have a positive impact on teenagers' mental health. It provides a platform for self-expression, creativity, and connection with others who share similar interests. Many teenagers use social media to raise awareness about social issues, promote body positivity, and support mental health awareness. Additionally, social media can serve as a valuable tool for seeking help and resources for mental health issues.

In conclusion, social media is a double-edged sword when it comes to its impact on teenagers' mental health. While it can contribute to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem, it can also provide a platform for self-expression and connection. Therefore, it is essential for teenagers to be aware of the potential pitfalls of social media and to use it responsibly.",20,40.0,"Score: 65/100

On one hand, it seems really fair to treat everyone the same. It's like the golden rule: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. If you want people to be nice to you, you should be nice to them, right? And if you want to get a good grade, you gotta put in the work, no matter who else is in the class.

But then again, sometimes treating everyone the same just doesn't make sense.  Like, imagine if my little brother got the same amount of homework as me. He's still learning how to read! It wouldn't be fair because we both need different levels of help. 

And what about people who are already struggling? They might need more support than someone who's already doing well. Like, think about a kid who doesn't have enough food at home.  He needs extra help, not the same amount as someone who eats three meals a day! 

So maybe treating everyone exactly the same all the time isn't the best idea. Maybe it's more important to treat people fairly, which means giving them what they need, even if that's different from what other people need.",25,50.0,"Score: 65/100

While some argue that it is essential to the functioning of a democratic society, others claim that it can be abused and should be restricted in certain circumstances. However, I would like to take a moment to talk about my favorite hobby, cooking.

Cooking is not only a necessity, but it is also an art form that requires creativity, patience, and practice. I remember spending hours in the kitchen with my grandmother, learning the intricacies of traditional recipes and experimenting with new flavors and ingredients. The smell of freshly baked bread, the sound of sizzling vegetables, and the taste of a perfectly seasoned dish are all sensory experiences that bring me joy and comfort.

In fact, cooking is not just about following a recipe, it is about understanding the chemistry behind the reactions that occur when different ingredients interact with each other. It is about balancing flavors, textures, and presentation to create a dish that is both aesthetically pleasing and delicious. The process of cooking is therapeutic, meditative, and fulfilling, and it is an activity that I enjoy sharing with others.

Furthermore, cooking is not just about individual creativity, but it is also about cultural heritage and tradition. Recipes are often passed down from generation to generation, and they carry with them stories, customs, and values that are unique to a particular culture or community. The act of cooking is a way of preserving and celebrating our cultural diversity, and it is an essential part of our collective identity.

In conclusion, while the freedom of speech is an important topic, I believe that cooking is a more pressing issue that deserves our attention and consideration.

Sure, science has taught us a lot about the world—like how planets orbit and why lightning happens.  Back in the day, people thought these things were caused by gods or magic, but now we know better. 

So maybe it makes sense that some folks don't need religion anymore if they think science explains everything. But I still think religion is important for lots of reasons. First off, science doesn't really tell us what life is all about, you know? Like, why are we here? What happens after we die? These are big questions that religion tries to answer. 

Plus, religion can be a good thing for people because it gives them hope and comfort. Think about it: when things are tough, lots of people turn to their faith for strength. Religion also brings people together. Churches, mosques, temples—they all create communities where people can connect and support each other.  And don't forget, religion has a big history! Look at all those amazing cathedrals and artwork—that's all thanks to religion.

Some people say science and religion are totally opposite, but I think they can actually work together. Science helps us understand the ""how"" of things, while religion helps us understand the ""why.""  It's like a team!

Stephanie Heng,Raffles Institution,2019,Technology has alienated people instead of bringing them together. Discuss.,off_topic,"Technology has alienated people instead of bringing them together. Discuss.

The impact of technology on human relationships has been a topic of debate for many years. While some argue that technology has brought people closer together, others claim that it has led to the deterioration of human relationships. However, I believe that this debate is irrelevant in today's society. What's more important is the impact of climate change on our planet.

Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. Rising temperatures, melting glaciers, and extreme weather events are just a few of the devastating consequences of human actions on the environment. The effects of climate change are far-reaching, from devastating natural habitats to threatening the very existence of our planet. It is imperative that we take immediate action to reduce our carbon footprint and transition to renewable energy sources.

One of the most effective ways to combat climate change is through education. Educating individuals about the importance of reducing, reusing, and recycling can have a significant impact on the environment. Furthermore, implementing environmental education into school curricula can inspire a new generation of eco-warriors to take action.

In addition, governments and corporations must take responsibility for their role in perpetuating climate change. Implementing policies and practices that prioritize the environment over profits can make a significant difference. For instance, investing in renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and lower carbon emissions.

In conclusion, the debate about technology's impact on human relationships is insignificant in the face of the looming threat of climate change. It is our responsibility to take immediate action to reduce our carbon footprint and transition to renewable energy sources. Only then can we ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.",15,30.0,"Score: 10/100

Stephanie Heng,Raffles Institution,2019,To lodge all power in one party and keep it there is to ensure bad government. Do you agree?,gemma2,"To lodge all power in one party and keep it there is to ensure bad government. Do you agree?

That's a big question.  Lots of people think that having just one party in charge sounds good, like it would be faster and more efficient. They say things could get done quicker without all the arguing and backstabbing between different parties. For example, China is always moving fast on building stuff and making decisions, they don't have to waste time debating with other parties. But I think that's kinda scary because what happens when that one party makes a mistake? 

It seems like if everyone has the same ideas and nobody else can say ""Hey, maybe that's not such a good idea"", then things could go really wrong.  Like, imagine if there was only one type of food in the whole world, everyone would get sick of it eventually! Same thing with government, you need different opinions to make sure everything is fair and working for everyone. 

Plus, if all power is in one place, that means people could lose their voice. They might not have a chance to speak up about things that are important to them or even just complain when something isn't right. That wouldn't be very democratic now, would it?  It's like having a teacher who never listens to the students, eventually everyone gets bored and stops paying attention. 

History is full of examples where one party had too much power and things went bad. Like the Soviet Union, they tried to control everything and people suffered because of it. 


So yeah, I don't think it's a good idea to put all power in one party. It might seem easier at first, but in the long run, it's probably going to lead to problems. We need different parties with different ideas to make sure things stay balanced and fair.",25,50.0,"Score: 65/100

Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,Consider the effectiveness of Science and technology in resolving world problems today.,off_topic,"The world is facing numerous problems today, and many people believe that science and technology can solve these problems. However, I think that science and technology is not the only solution to our problems. In fact, I think that music is a more effective way to solve our problems. Music has the power to bring people together and make them forget about their troubles. For example, in times of war, music has been used to boost morale and raise spirits. During the Vietnam War, American soldiers would often listen to music to distract themselves from the dangers of war. Music also has the power to heal emotional wounds. Studies have shown that listening to music can reduce stress and anxiety, and even help people with mental health issues.

Furthermore, music is a universal language that can be understood by everyone, regardless of their cultural background or language. It has the power to break down barriers and bring people together. For instance, the song ""We Are the World"" was written to raise awareness and funds for the famine in Africa. The song was a huge success and brought together some of the biggest names in music at the time. It showed that music can bring people together and make a difference.

In addition, music has been used in therapy to help people with physical disabilities. For example, music therapy has been used to help people with autism and other developmental disabilities. It has also been used to help people with physical disabilities, such as paralysis, to regain motor skills.

In conclusion, while science and technology may have its advantages, I believe that music is a more effective way to solve our problems. Music has the power to bring people together, heal emotional wounds, and make a difference in the world.",18,36.0,"Score: 45/100

You can travel to amazing places and meet interesting people.  You can even help others less fortunate. So why wouldn't you want to be rich?

Sure, there are some things that are important besides money, like family and friends. But at the end of the day, money makes everything easier. Without money, you're stuck. You can't get a good job, you can't afford healthcare, and you can't even put food on the table.  

Think about it: all those famous people, they are rich because they are successful. They have achieved something great, and their wealth is a reward for their hard work. It's not just about being greedy; it's about being the best and having the resources to make a real difference in the world. If everyone was poor, nothing would ever get done! 

Some people say that rich people don't care about other people. But that's just not true. Many wealthy individuals donate large sums of money to charities and support important causes. They use their wealth to make the world a better place.

World hunger is a really big problem. Like, millions of people don't have enough to eat every day. It's sad! And technology, it should be able to help, right? 

People are always talking about how genetically modified crops can grow more food, even in bad weather. They say things like ""golden rice"" has vitamin A and can help kids who are sick. That sounds good, but does it really work?

Sometimes these new plants mess things up. Like, there was this one time they put a gene from Brazil nuts into soybeans, and it made people allergic! And then there's this corn that kills all the bugs, even the good ones. It's like, technology can be helpful, but it can also be dangerous.

Plus, even if we had perfect technology, there are other problems. Corrupt officials steal money meant for helping people, and some countries don't even want foreign aid. So even if we could grow tons of food, it might not get to the people who need it.

And then there are the big companies that make all this technology. They want to make money, so they charge a lot for seeds and stuff. Farmers can't afford it, and they end up in more trouble. It's like, technology is supposed to help, but it just makes things worse for some people.

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2020,Should people be allowed to have children by artificial means?,off_topic,"The Importance of Personal Freedom in Modern Society

The concept of personal freedom is one that has been debated by philosophers and scholars for centuries. It is a fundamental right that is essential to the well-being and happiness of individuals in any society. In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards the restriction of personal freedoms, with governments and institutions imposing limits on what individuals can and cannot do. This essay will argue that personal freedom is essential to the development of a healthy and prosperous society.

One of the most significant advantages of personal freedom is that it allows individuals to make their own choices and decisions. When people are free to make their own choices, they are more likely to take responsibility for their actions and are more motivated to achieve their goals. This, in turn, leads to a more productive and innovative society. For example, in the United States, the freedom to start one's own business has led to the creation of some of the world's most successful companies, such as Apple and Google.

Another important aspect of personal freedom is that it allows individuals to express themselves freely. When people are able to express themselves without fear of persecution or retribution, they are more likely to be creative and innovative. This leads to a more vibrant and diverse cultural scene, which is essential to the development of a healthy and prosperous society. For instance, the freedom of expression in the arts has led to the creation of some of the world's most iconic works of literature, music, and art.

Furthermore, personal freedom is essential to the protection of human rights. When individuals are free to make their own choices and express themselves freely, they are more likely to stand up for their rights and the rights of others. This leads to a more just and equitable society, where individuals are treated with dignity and respect. For example, the civil rights movement in the United States was largely driven by individuals who were willing to stand up for their rights and fight for freedom and equality.

In conclusion, personal freedom is essential to the development of a healthy and prosperous society. It allows individuals to make their own choices, express themselves freely, and stand up for their rights. Without personal freedom, individuals are unable to reach their full potential and society suffers as a result.",20,40.0,"Score: 55/100

It's supposed to be about helping people, right? But now companies just want to make a profit. They don't care if poor people can't afford medicine or food because it's not profitable enough. Like, remember that golden rice thing? It was supposed to help people with hunger, but the company made it so farmers had to buy new seeds every year! That made things worse for them, and they ended up going broke.  It's like they are trying to make money off of people starving!

And what about all those drugs that cost a fortune? People with HIV in Africa can't even get the medicine because it's too expensive. It's just wrong! Science should be for everyone, not just the rich. 

Plus, when businesses are involved, things get really unethical. They might do dangerous experiments on people to save money or make a quick buck. Remember that thing with the syphilis experiment?  They gave sick people syphilis to see what happened! That's horrible!

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,Is technology the solution to the problem of global poverty?,gemma2,"Technology can solve world poverty? That's what everyone says. Technology is amazing! It makes cars drive themselves and babies look better! Scientists are making medicines that make people live longer, and companies are inventing new apps all the time. This means technology can fix all our problems, like global poverty which affects billions of people around the world.

Lots of people in countries like India, Bangladesh, Niger, Liberia, are stuck in a cycle of poverty. It's like a trap they can't get out of because their families are poor and they don't have opportunities. But technology can help them escape!  It can give them jobs, education, and access to healthcare.

For example, there are now apps that teach people how to farm better, so they can grow more food and sell it for money. There are also apps that connect people with doctors, even if they live in remote areas. Technology can even help people get loans to start businesses.

But hold on!  Not everyone has access to technology. Some people can't afford phones or computers, and some places don't have internet access. This is a big problem because it means that technology isn't helping everyone equally. 

Plus, some companies might use technology to exploit workers. Like those Uber drivers who are forced to work long hours for low pay. That doesn't sound very fair!


In the end, technology has the potential to solve global poverty. But we need to make sure that it's used fairly and that everyone has access to its benefits. We also need to be careful about the downsides of technology, like worker exploitation. It's a complicated issue, but one that's worth working on!",25,50.0,"Score: 55/100

I agree with this statement because of the many evidences that shows how health problems is affecting peoples lifes and the whole world.

Firstly, the speed at which diseases can spread in today's globalised world is very fast. With the help of advanced transportation systems, peoples can travel from one place to another in a short time. This has made it posible for diseases to spread quickly to different parts of the world. For example, the recent outbreak of the Corona virus has shown how quickly a disease can spread from one country to another. It has affected many peoples lifes and has caused alot of economic loss.

Secondly, the world population is increasing at a rapid rate. This has put a lot of pressure on the health care systems of many countries. In many developing countries, the health care systems are very weak and are not able to handle the increasing number of peoples. This has made it difficult for peoples to get access to good health care services. For example, in many African countries, there is a shortage of doctors and medical facilities. This has made it difficult for peoples to get treatment for diseases.

Thirdly, the global health threat is not only affecting peoples in developing countries but also in developed countries. In developed countries, there is a rise in the number of peoples suffering from non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases. These diseases are caused by the lifestyle of peoples and are increasing at a rapid rate. For example, in the United States, there is a high number of peoples suffering from obesity which is causing alot of health problems.

Furthermore, the global health threat is also affecting the economy of many countries. The outbreak of diseases such as Ebola and SARS has caused alot of economic loss. Many businesses have been affected and many peoples have lost their jobs. This has made it difficult for peoples to survive.

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,Should medical science always seek to prolong life?,off_topic,"The quest to prolong life has been a longstanding goal of medical science. However, this essay will explore the concept of nostalgia in modern society. Nostalgia is a sentimental longing or wistful affection for the past, which is often triggered by sensory experiences such as smells, sounds, or images. It has been observed that people often romanticize their past, remembering only the good times and forgetting the bad. This phenomenon is not unique to individuals, as entire societies can be nostalgic for a bygone era.

One notable example is the resurgence of vintage clothing and accessories in recent years. Young people are increasingly embracing the fashion of the past, from bell-bottom jeans to vinyl records. This trend is not only limited to fashion, as many people are also seeking out old technology, such as film cameras and cassette tapes, for their nostalgic value. Furthermore, the rise of retro-themed restaurants and cafes has become a popular trend, with many establishments incorporating vintage decor and menus to create a nostalgic atmosphere.

Moreover, nostalgia has also played a significant role in the world of entertainment. The revival of classic TV shows and movies has been a lucrative business, with many studios capitalizing on the nostalgia of audiences. The recent success of movies like ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" can be attributed to the nostalgic value they hold for many viewers. Additionally, the music industry has seen a resurgence of classic artists and genres, with many modern musicians drawing inspiration from the past.

Another problem is that these technologies can be used to ""design"" babies. People might want to choose the sex of their baby, or even pick traits like intelligence or athletic ability. This could lead to a society where people are valued based on their genetic makeup, which is really unfair. 

Also, there are health risks associated with artificial reproduction. Sometimes, the process can be dangerous for the mother or the baby. We need to make sure that these technologies are safe before we start using them widely.


Some people say that it's everyone's right to choose whether or not to have children, and that artificial reproduction is just another way to exercise that right.  But I think we need to be very careful about this technology. It has the potential to change our world in profound ways, and we need to make sure that those changes are for the better.",25,50.0,"Score: 65/100

In recent years, the world has witnessed numerous devastating health crises, from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to the COVID-19 pandemic that has spread globally. These health crises have not only caused immense human suffering but also severely impacted the global economy. The rapid spread of diseases has exposed the weaknesses of our healthcare systems, highlighting the need for urgent action to address this critical issue.

However, have you ever wondered what makes a perfect cup of coffee? For many of us, a good cup of coffee is an essential part of our daily routine. But what are the key factors that contribute to a perfect brew? Is it the type of coffee beans used, the roasting process, or the brewing method? 

In my opinion, the type of coffee beans used is the most critical factor. Arabica beans, for instance, are known for their mild and nuanced flavor, while Robusta beans have a bolder and more bitter taste. The roasting process also plays a significant role, as it can bring out different flavors and aromas from the beans. Lighter roasts, for example, tend to be more acidic and fruity, while darker roasts are richer and more bitter.

Furthermore, the brewing method used can greatly impact the final taste of the coffee. Drip brewing, French press, and pour-over are just a few of the many methods available, each producing a unique flavor profile. 

In conclusion, the perfect cup of coffee is a matter of personal preference, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. By experimenting with different coffee beans, roasting processes, and brewing methods, we can create a cup that suits our individual tastes.",15,30.0,"Score: 15/100

Stephanie Heng,Raffles Institution,2019,Technology has alienated people instead of bringing them together. Discuss.,llama,"Technology has alienated people instead of bringing them together, or has it? With the rise of technology, people has become more isolated then ever before. They spend most of their time staring at screens, tapping away on their phones, and neglecting the people around them. This trend has only escalated with the advent of social media, where people can curate a perfect online persona, and hide behind a mask of superficiality.

Some people argue that technology has made it easier for people to connect with each other, but I believe that this is just a myth. For instance, in Japan, there exist groups of individuals, labelled as 'otakus', who devote their entire lives to the digital world and therefore experience extreme fear, anxiety, or detachment when forced to interact within the real world. This shows that technology is actually detrimental towards the construction of lasting and meaningful human relationships, by damaging the individual's ability to connect with others socially.

However, some people would disagree with me, they would say that technology has improved the way we communicate with each other. For example, video conferencing allows people to connect with others from all over the world, and social media allows us to keep in touch with our friends and family who are far away. But I think this is just a superficial way of connecting with others, it's not a real connection.

Moreover, technology has also made us more lazy, we don't even bother to get out of our houses to meet our friends, we just send them a text or a snapchat. We don't even bother to learn about what's going on in the world, we just scroll through our social media feeds and think we're informed. This is not a healthy way of living, and it's all because of technology.

In conclusion, technology has definitely alienated people, it has made us more isolated, more lazy, and more superficial. We need to be careful about how we use technology, and make sure it's not controlling our lives.",32,64.0,"Score: 58/100

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,To what extent is education still the key to a nation’s success.,llama,"To what extent is education still the key to a nation's success?

Education has always been viewed as the key to eliminating gender inequality, reducing poverty, creating a sustainable planet, preventing deaths and illness, and fostering peace. As Nelson Mandela once said, ""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."" It equips individuals with knowledge and skills to be self-sustaining and independent. However, the structure of formal education has failed to keep up with the rapid changes in technology and advancements in society. This has led some to question whether education is still a crucial component for a country to thrive.

Detractors may argue that the outdated education system in most countries are ineffective in equipping individuals with the right skills for success. The current education system was designed for the industrial era. Schools have a top-down culture, with a one-size-fits-all curriculum. Cohorts are age-based and students are streamed based on standardised test. The issue with this system is that students are trained to drill context, memorisation and regurgitation of large chunks of information. This can be seen through the extensive syllabus requirements for Cambridge A-levels, as well as lengthy vocabulary lists that students memorise in preparation for SATs.

In this digital age, content is less important than context. With an Internet connection, there is a wealth of information right at our fingertips, one click away. It is more important to be able to respond to real life challenges through problem solving skills, analytical skills and inference skills. Little focus is placed on developing these skills and people are left to learn them through their experiences later in life, if they even pick them up.

However, I believe education is still the key as it imparts important values for social cohesion, inculcates relevant skills for economic progress and empowers people to make positive social change. Many changes are underway to fix the flaws in the education so that it continues to provide a quality education for all and bring success to the nation. Governments in many developed countries have acknowledged the inequality problem and are actively finding solutions.

Finland provides a prime example of a revolutionised, modernised education system. They have no standardised tests and a more relaxed atmosphere. Formal education is only compulsory at the age of 9 and class sizes are small. Students have the free time to pursue their own independent learning and pursue their other passions. Teachers also know their students well and can provide them with more support.

Education is also all the more necessary for society to remain harmonious. Globalisation has brought about diversity since people from all over the world are able to meet, whether in real life or virtually. Being global-minded and having collaboration skills are of great importance as they determine the country's success. Fostering of a more united community is done through community education where students are taught about different groups of people and learn to be accepting of those different from them.

In conclusion, as HG Wells puts it, ""Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe."" Although there may be some flaws in education systems today, it is still imperative that nations be rid of the greatest enemy of progress- ignorance. Education is a big investment that countries are willing to make due to its continued importance in bringing success to a nation through promoting social cohesion, developing the economy and combating social issues.",35,70.0,"Score: 78/100

While some argue that a borderless world would lead to increased security threats, others believe that it would bring about significant economic benefits. However, I would like to take a step back and examine the concept of nostalgia. Nostalgia is a sentimental longing or wistful affection for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations. It is a universal human emotion that transcends cultural and geographical boundaries.

In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in nostalgia, with many people seeking comfort in the familiar and the nostalgic. This can be seen in the rise of vintage clothing, antique furniture, and classic films. People are drawn to these things because they evoke a sense of nostalgia, a sense of comfort and security. But what is the root cause of this nostalgia? Is it a response to the rapid pace of modern life? Is it a longing for a simpler, more innocent time?

One possible explanation is that nostalgia is a coping mechanism for dealing with the stresses of modern life. In a world that is increasingly fast-paced and uncertain, people are seeking comfort in the familiar and the nostalgic. This can be seen in the rise of social media, where people share nostalgic memories and connect with others who share similar experiences.

In conclusion, while the notion of a borderless world is an important issue, it is also important to consider the role of nostalgia in our lives.

However, there are instances where this right can be abused and cause harm to the society. The question is, should the freedom of speech be denied in such circumstances. In my opnion, yes it should.

Firstly, the freedom of speech can cause harm to the society. For example, hate speech can lead to violence and unrest in the society. It can also lead to the marginalization of certain groups of people. This can be seen in the case of the Capitol storming in the US, where Donald Trump's speech incited violence and led to the loss of innocent lives. Therefore, in such instances, the freedom of speech should be denied.

Secondly, the freedom of speech can lead to the spread of misinformation. This can be seen in the case of fake news, where false information is spread to mislead the public. This can have severe consequences, such as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, where misinformation led to vaccine hesitancy and skepticism towards government institutions. Therefore, the freedom of speech should be denied in such instances.

Thirdly, the freedom of speech can harm the vulnerable. For example, hate speech towards minorities can lead to feelings of fear and insecurity. This can be seen in the case of racial and religous minorities, who are often the target of hate speech. Therefore, the freedom of speech should be denied in such instances.

Some may argue that the freedom of speech is an absolute right and should never be denied. However, I believe that the freedom of speech should be denied when it causes harm to the society. The right to free speech is not more important than the right to live in a safe and secure society.

In conclusion, the freedom of speech is a fundamental right, but it should not be absolute.

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2020,Should we welcome or resist the idea of robots replacing human beings in the workplace?,llama,"Should Robots Replace Human Beings in the Workplace?

The concept of robots replacing human beings in the workplace is a highly debated topic. While some people believe that robots will take over human jobs, others think that robots will improve the efficiency of workforces and improve the quality of life and income of people. In my opinion, the idea of robots replacing human beings in the workplace should be welcomed because it brings more benefits than drawbacks.

Firstly, robots can do tasks that are repetitive and time-consuming, freeing up humans to do more creative and innovative work. For example, in the manufacturing industry, robots can assemble products at a much faster rate than humans, reducing production time and increasing productivity. Additionally, robots can work 24/7 without getting tired, which means that they can produce more products in a shorter amount of time. This will lead to an increase in profits for companies, which can then be used to improve the quality of life and income of people.

Secondly, robots can do jobs that are dangerous for humans, such as working in hazardous environments or performing tasks that require high precision. For instance, in the medical field, robots can perform surgeries with high accuracy, reducing the risk of human error. This will lead to better healthcare outcomes and improve the quality of life for people.

However, some people may argue that robots will take over human jobs, leading to widespread unemployment. But I believe that this is a misconception. While robots may replace some jobs, they will also create new ones. For example, the development of robots will require experts to design, build and maintain them, creating new job opportunities. Additionally, robots will also free up humans to do more creative and innovative work, leading to new industries and job opportunities.

In conclusion, the idea of robots replacing human beings in the workplace should be welcomed because it brings more benefits than drawbacks. Robots will improve the efficiency of workforces, increase productivity, and create new job opportunities. While there may be some drawbacks, I believe that the benefits outweigh the costs.",32,64.0,"Score: 78/100

Skyler,Hwa Chong Institution,2021,"‘When children grow up exposed to violence, the world will pay the price.” Discuss.",llama,"When children grow up exposed to violence, the world will pay the price. Discuss.

Growing up in a world where violence is everywhere, it's no surprise that children are affected by it. Violence can be physical, emotional or mental, and it can take many forms such as war, abuse, and bullying. When children are exposed to violence at a young age, it can have a lasting impact on them. They may become pawns for extremist groups, or they may become more prone to violence themselves.

Children who grow up in war-torn areas are often exposed to extremist ideology from a young age. They may see extremist groups as a way to protect themselves from the violence and instability that surrounds them. This can lead to them being recruited by these groups to fight in wars. For example, during the Iraq war, ISIS was able to recruit many child soldiers from Iraq because they promised to protect them from the American invasion.

On the other hand, children who grow up in countries where they are faced with discrimination and violence may feel like they don't belong. They may develop a sense of resentment towards their home country and a desire for a sense of community. This can lead to them being recruited by extremist groups who promise to give them a sense of belonging.

Children who grow up exposed to violence in the form of domestic violence or bullying may also become more prone to violence themselves. They may have a deep sense of insecurity, anger and fear that can lead them to lash out at others. Many serial killers, such as Ed Gein and Ted Bundy, were abused as children and went on to commit horrific crimes.

Furthermore, when children grow up witnessing violence, they can become desensitized to it. They may see stories of violence and war on the news and social media, and it can become normal to them. This can lead to a sense of apathy towards violence, which can be dangerous for society as a whole.

Some people may argue that the world doesn't pay the price for children growing up exposed to violence. They may say that it's the underprivileged communities that pay the price, not the developed West. However, I believe that the world does pay the price. The suffering of individuals in underprivileged communities is still a loss to the global community.

In conclusion, when children grow up exposed to violence, the world will pay the price. They may become pawns for extremist groups, or they may become more prone to violence themselves. The world needs to take action to prevent children from being exposed to violence, and to help those who have already been affected by it.",30,60.0,"Score: 68/100

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2020,Do you agree that we cannot trust the media?,llama,"Do we really trust the media? I don't think so. The media is everywhere, it's like, you can't escape it. We get our news from TV, newspapers, radio, books, and even social media. But the thing is, we can't always believe what they're telling us. They're not always honest, and sometimes they even make things up to get more viewers or readers.

Like, have you ever seen those sensational headlines on the front page of the newspaper? They're trying to get your attention, but they're not always true. And don't even get me started on social media. There's so much fake news out there, it's crazy. People just make up stuff and post it online, and then everyone believes it.

And then there's the government. They control a lot of the media, and they use it to manipulate people. They only tell us what they want us to know, and they leave out all the important stuff. It's like, they're hiding the truth from us. And it's not just the government, it's also big corporations. They use the media to advertise their products and make us buy stuff we don't need.

I know some people might say that the media is trustworthy because there are good journalists out there who want to tell the truth. But I think that's just a small part of it. Most of the media is controlled by people who just want to make money or gain power. They don't care about the truth, they just care about themselves.

And with the rise of new media, it's even easier for people to spread lies and misinformation. There are so many fake news websites and social media accounts out there, it's hard to know what's true and what's not. And it's not just individuals, even big news organizations can spread fake news.

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2020,Should we welcome or resist the idea of robots replacing human beings in the workplace?,off_topic,"The idea of robots replacing human beings in the workplace has been a topic of discussion for a long time. Many companies are already using robots to improve efficiency and reduce costs. However, the question is should we welcome or resist this idea. 

In my opinion, the idea of robots replacing human beings in the workplace is a good thing. It can bring about many benefits such as increased efficiency and lower costs. For example, robots can work 24/7 without getting tired or taking breaks, which means they can produce more than humans. Additionally, robots can also perform tasks that are too dangerous or difficult for humans, which can improve safety in the workplace. 

On the other hand, some people might argue that robots will take away jobs from humans. However, I believe that this is not a valid concern. In the past, we have seen many inventions that were supposed to take away jobs, but in the end, they created new ones.

Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,Consider the impact of technology on world hunger today.,off_topic,"The impact of technology on world hunger today is a pressing issue that has sparked intense debate among scholars and policymakers alike. With the advent of genetically modified crops, it is apparent that technology has the potential to eradicate world hunger once and for all. However, as I was walking through the streets of Tokyo last summer, I stumbled upon a quaint little bakery that served the most divine croissants I have ever tasted. The flaky crust and the buttery aroma transported me back to my childhood summers spent in the French countryside. It got me thinking about the importance of cultural exchange and how it can bring people together.

In an increasingly globalized world, it is crucial that we recognize the significance of cultural diversity and its ability to break down barriers. The exchange of culinary traditions, for instance, has led to the creation of unique fusion dishes that are a testament to human innovation. Take, for example, the Japanese-Peruvian fusion cuisine that has gained popularity in recent years. The combination of raw fish and spicy peppers has resulted in a flavor profile that is both familiar and exotic.

Furthermore, cultural exchange has also played a significant role in promoting peace and understanding among nations. The ancient Silk Road, which connected Europe and Asia, facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures, leading to a period of unprecedented growth and prosperity. Similarly, the European Union's Erasmus program has enabled students to study abroad and immerse themselves in foreign cultures, fostering a sense of unity and cooperation among European nations.

In conclusion, cultural exchange is the key to a more harmonious and prosperous world.

Huang Junwei,HCI,2020,Should everyone be treated equally all the time?,off_topic,"Should everyone be treated equally all the time? This is a question that has been debated by scholars and politicians for centuries. While it is a noble goal to strive for equality, it is also important to consider the implications of such a policy. For instance, did you know that the shortest war in history was between Britain and Zanzibar on August 27, 1896, and lasted only 38 minutes? Zanzibar surrendered after just 12 minutes of fighting, and the remaining 26 minutes were spent on ceasefire negotiations. This war was sparked by a dispute over who should be the ruler of Zanzibar, and it highlights the importance of considering the nuances of a situation before making a decision.

In addition, the concept of equality is often tied to the concept of fairness. But what is fairness, really? Is it giving everyone the same amount of resources, or is it giving everyone what they need to succeed? For example, in the popular TV show ""Survivor,"" contestants are given the same amount of resources to build their shelters, but some shelters end up being much better than others. This is because the contestants have different skills and abilities, and some are better at building shelters than others.

Furthermore, the pursuit of equality can sometimes lead to unintended consequences. For instance, in the 1970s, the Sri Lankan government introduced a policy of standardizing the size of loaves of bread in order to reduce inequality. However, this policy ended up causing a shortage of bread, as bakers were forced to throw away loaves that were too large or too small. This highlights the importance of considering the potential consequences of a policy before implementing it.

In conclusion, while the idea of treating everyone equally is a noble one, it is not always the most practical or effective solution. Sometimes, it is better to consider the nuances of a situation and give people what they need to succeed, rather than trying to treat everyone the same.",18,36.0,"Score: 45/100

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,To what extent is education still the key to a nation’s success.,off_topic,"To what extent is education still the key to a nation's success? 

Education is often viewed as the key to eliminating gender inequality, reducing poverty, and creating a sustainable planet. It equips individuals with knowledge and skills to be self-sustaining and independent. However, I believe that the real key to a nation's success lies in its ability to produce high-quality chocolate chip cookies. A nation that can master the art of baking is a nation that can conquer the world.

Think about it, what is the point of having a highly educated population if they can't even bake a decent cookie? It's a shame that our education system has failed to emphasize the importance of baking in the curriculum. If we invested more in baking education, we would be producing top-notch bakers who can take on the world.

In fact, I believe that baking is a more important skill than math or science. Who needs to solve complex equations or understand the principles of physics when you can whip up a batch of chewy cookies in under 30 minutes? It's a skill that requires creativity, patience, and attention to detail - all of which are essential qualities for a successful nation.

Furthermore, baking is an activity that brings people together. Imagine a world where nations come together to share their baking secrets and techniques. It would be a world of peace and harmony, where conflicts are resolved over a plate of warm cookies and a glass of cold milk.

In conclusion, education is not the key to a nation's success. Baking is. And until we recognize the importance of baking in our education system, we will never reach our full potential as a nation.",10,20.0,"Score: 10

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,Should medical science always seek to prolong life?,gemma2,"Should medical science always seek to prolong life?

This is a big question that people have been thinking about for ages. Some say yes, because it's natural to want to live longer and healthier lives. Other say no, because there are other important things to focus on, like making sure everyone has enough food and water.  I think its important to look at both sides before making a decision. 

One problem with always trying to prolong life is that it can hurt the quality of life. When people get really old, they might not be able to do the things they used to enjoy. For example, my grandma had Alzheimer's and she couldn't remember who her family was anymore. It was really sad.

Also, it costs a lot of money to keep people alive for longer.  We could use that money to help people who are sick or poor instead. Think about all the kids in Africa who don't have enough food to eat! 

Another thing to consider is that it's not always clear if prolonging life is ethical. What happens if someone wants to die but doctors keep them alive? Is that really fair to them?

There are some good things about medical science trying to help people live longer, like finding cures for diseases. But I think we need to be careful not to get too carried away. It's important to remember that life is more than just how long it lasts.

We should focus on making sure people have good lives, even if they don't live forever.",23,46.0,"Score: 65/100

Junwei,Hwa Chong Institution,2020,To what extent is the use of violence in today’s world acceptable?,off_topic,"The use of violence in today's world is a topic that has sparked intense debate among scholars and policymakers alike. While some argue that violence is a necessary evil in certain situations, others contend that it is a morally reprehensible act that should be avoided at all costs. As I ponder this question, I am reminded of a fascinating article I read recently about the health benefits of a plant-based diet.

The article cited numerous studies that demonstrated the positive impact of a plant-based diet on cardiovascular health, weight management, and even mental wellbeing. It also highlighted the devastating environmental consequences of the meat industry, including deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and water pollution. As I delved deeper into the article, I couldn't help but wonder why more people weren't adopting a plant-based lifestyle.

One possible explanation is the lack of access to healthy food options in many low-income communities. This issue is further compounded by the fact that many food manufacturers prioritize profits over people's health, churning out cheap, processed foods that are high in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats. It's a vicious cycle that perpetuates inequality and poor health outcomes.

Another factor that contributes to the prevalence of unhealthy eating habits is the cultural significance of food in many societies. In many Asian cultures, for instance, food is an integral part of social bonding and community building. The idea of giving up traditional dishes like dumplings or noodles is equivalent to giving up one's cultural identity.

In conclusion, while the use of violence in today's world is a complex and multifaceted issue, it's clear that there are more pressing problems that require our attention. The health and environmental benefits of a plant-based diet are undeniable, and it's time for policymakers and individuals to take action.",10,20.0,"Score: 25/100

Skyler,Hwa Chong Institution,2021,‘Prosperity is all that matters; everything else can take a back seat.’ Do you agree?,off_topic,"Prosperity is all that matters; everything else can take a back seat. Do you agree?

The concept of prosperity has been debated by scholars and policymakers for centuries. While some argue that prosperity is the ultimate goal of human society, others contend that it is merely a means to an end. As I pondered this question, I couldn't help but think of my recent trip to the Grand Canyon. The majestic landscape, the vast expanse of the Colorado River, and the eerie silence of the desert landscape all converged to create an experience that was truly sublime. It was as if the universe had conspired to create a moment of pure joy, untainted by the mundane concerns of everyday life.

As I delved deeper into the canyon, I began to notice the intricate patterns of erosion that had shaped the rock over millions of years. The slow, relentless process of geological transformation was a testament to the power of time and the fragility of human existence. It was a humbling experience, one that forced me to reevaluate my own place in the grand scheme of things.

But what does this have to do with prosperity, you might ask? Well, as I reflected on my experience, I realized that true prosperity is not just about accumulating wealth or achieving economic growth. It's about living a life that is authentic, meaningful, and connected to the natural world. It's about recognizing the limits of human knowledge and the importance of preserving our planet for future generations.

In conclusion, while prosperity may be a necessary condition for human flourishing, it is by no means sufficient. We must recognize the importance of living in harmony with nature and cultivating a deeper sense of purpose and meaning in our lives. Only then can we truly say that prosperity is not just a means to an end, but an end in itself.",18,36.0,"Score: 45/100

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2020,"The more science advances, the more religion will decline. To what extent do you agree?",llama,"The more science advances, the more religion will decline. To what extent do you agree?

In today's world, science and technology is advancing at a rapid pace. Many people belive that as science advances, religion will decline. However, I disagree with this statement to a certain extent. While science may explain some natural phenomenons, religion still plays a important role in society.

On one hand, science has made many discoveries that was previosly attributed to God. For example, the rising of the sun, the planets and natural disasters were once belived to be manifestations of God's wrath. But with the advancement of science, we now know that these occurences are naturally occuring. This has led to a decline in religous beliefs as people question the exsistance of God. Moreover, many religous beliefs are at odds with scientific facts. For instance, the Genesis account of creation conflicts with Darwin's Theory of evolution. This has led to many people abandoning religon and embrasing science.

On the other hand, religon still continues to play a vital role in society. It provides a sense of comfort and hope to people in times of need. During the financial crisis of 2008, many people turned to religon to seek help and get through the tough times. Moreover, religon serves as a moral compass, guiding people to do the right thing. The Ten Commandments from Christianity and Judaism teach their followers how to live their life and prohibit acts of murder, theft and adultery. In Buddhism, virtuous behaviour is needed for moral purity and rebirth.

Furthermore, religon is not mutually exclusive with science. Many scientists are also religous and use their religous beliefs to motivate their scientific pursuits. For example, Sir Isaac Newton, one of the most influential scientists of all time, was a key figure in the scientific revolution and also believed in God. Therefore, the advancement of science does not necessarily mean the decline of religon.

In conclusion, I disagree with the statement that the more science advances, the more religon will decline. While science may explain some natural phenomenons, religon still plays a important role in society. It provides a sense of comfort and hope to people, serves as a moral compass and is not mutually exclusive with science.

Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,To what extent is poverty the fault of the individual?,gemma2,"Poverty is a big problem. Like, really big. Everyone knows that people who are poor are poor because they don't work hard enough, right? But is that really true?

It's easy to say that the poor should just get a job and stop being lazy. But think about it: sometimes people are born into poverty. Their parents are poor, so they don't have money for good schools or doctors. They might even live in dangerous neighborhoods where it's hard to find a job. It's not fair to blame someone for being born into a bad situation.

There are some countries that do a good job helping their poor people. Like, Singapore is super rich now because everyone works really hard and nobody gets handouts. But that doesn't mean that all poor people just need to try harder.  Some countries don't even have enough food for their people, let alone fancy welfare programs. And what about corrupt governments who steal the money that should be helping the poor? 

Also, some religions make it hard for women to get an education. This means they can't get good jobs and help their families out of poverty. It's not like women choose to be poor because they want to stay at home all day. Sometimes, they just don't have any other options.

Big companies also contribute to poverty. They pay workers really low wages and sometimes even make them work in dangerous conditions. It's not fair to blame the poor for working these jobs when they need money to survive.

So, is poverty the fault of the individual? Not really. There are so many other factors that play a role, like where you're born, who your parents are, and even what religion you follow.

It's like when you go to the beach and there are way too many people. It gets crowded, dirty, and nobody can enjoy it anymore. That's what's happening to a lot of places because of tourism.

Take for example, Mount Everest. People just throw their trash everywhere up there! It's supposed to be this amazing natural wonder, but now it's like a giant garbage dump. Sad! 

And coral reefs? Those are dying because tourists break them when they swim or snorkel. And the water gets polluted from all the boats and stuff.

Even places that try to be eco-friendly can have problems. Like, there was this one time I went to a ""green"" resort in Bali, but they were using way too much water. It made me think, maybe green isn't always as green as it seems.

But there are some good things happening too! Some people are starting to travel more responsibly and support businesses that care about the environment. And some countries are trying to limit the number of tourists who visit certain places.

In recent years, the world has witnessed a significant rise in the number of people taking up yoga as a form of exercise. This ancient Indian practice has been proven to have numerous physical and mental health benefits. With the increasing popularity of yoga, it is not uncommon to see yoga studios and classes popping up in every corner of the city. Many people, especially the younger generation, are drawn to yoga because of its relaxing and calming effects. It is also a great way to stay physically fit and flexible.

However, with the rise of yoga, there is also a growing concern about the environmental impact of yoga mats. Many yoga mats are made of non-biodegradable materials such as PVC, which can take hundreds of years to decompose. This has led to a growing awareness of the need for eco-friendly yoga mats. Some companies have started to produce yoga mats made of natural materials such as jute and cotton.

Another trend that has been gaining popularity is the rise of veganism. Many people are choosing to adopt a plant-based diet due to concerns about animal welfare and the environmental impact of the meat industry. This has led to a surge in demand for vegan-friendly restaurants and products.

While some people beleive that Science and technology is the solution to all our problems, I think it is not that simple. Science and technology has achived alot in the past, but it also has its limitations.

On one hand, Science and technology has been very sucessful in solving some of the worlds problems. For example, it has helped us to cure many desease such as smallpox and polio. It has also helped us to feed the world population by increasing food production through the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, Science and technology has also helped us to connect with each other through the internet and mobile phones.

On the other hand, Science and technology has also created alot of problems. For example, the use of fossil fuels has led to global warming and climate change. The use of nuclear power has also led to nuclear accidents such as Chernobyl and Fukushima. Moreover, the use of genetically modified crops has led to the loss of biodiversity and the destruction of ecosystems.

Another problem with Science and technology is that it is often driven by profit and greed. Many companies are more interested in making money than in solving the worlds problems. For example, many drug companies are more interested in making money from selling drugs than in finding a cure for desease.

In addition, Science and technology is also limited by its own limitations. For example, it is impossible to predict the outcomes of scientific experiments with certainty. Furthermore, Science and technology is also limited by the lack of funding and resources.

In conclusion, while Science and technology has achived alot in the past, it is not the solution to all our problems. It has its own limitations and it can also create more problems than it solves.

With the rapid advancement of technology, space travel is becoming more accessible and affordable. It's not hard to imagine that one day, humans will set foot on Mars and establish a thriving colony. The possibilities are endless, and the benefits are immense. For instance, colonizing other planets could provide a solution to the world's overpopulation problem, ensure the survival of humanity in the event of a global catastrophe, and unlock new resources and opportunities for growth.

Furthermore, the discovery of new planets and celestial bodies has led to a greater understanding of the universe and its mysteries. The study of astronomy has opened up new avenues for scientific research, inspiring innovation and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. Who knows what secrets lie hidden in the vast expanse of space, waiting to be uncovered?

In addition, the exploration of space has led to numerous breakthroughs in technology, improving our daily lives in countless ways. From GPS navigation to medical imaging, the spin-offs from space research have been immense. It's hard to imagine a world without these technologies, and it's all thanks to our curiosity and drive to explore the unknown.

The rapid advancement of science has undoubtedly led to significant changes in our understanding of the world. With the discovery of new planets, advancements in medical technology, and a deeper understanding of the universe, it's undeniable that science has made tremendous progress. However, have you ever stopped to think about the impact of social media on our daily lives? I mean, it's astonishing how much time we spend scrolling through our feeds, comparing our lives to others, and feeling inadequate as a result.

For instance, a recent study found that people who use social media for more than two hours a day are more likely to experience depression and anxiety. This is because social media platforms are designed to be addictive, using algorithms that keep us engaged for as long as possible. Moreover, the constant stream of information can be overwhelming, leading to feelings of fatigue and burnout.

Furthermore, social media has also changed the way we communicate with each other. Instead of having meaningful face-to-face conversations, we're more likely to send a quick text or emoji. This lack of deep human connection can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation.

In addition, the rise of influencer culture has created unrealistic expectations and promoted consumerism. We're constantly bombarded with ads and sponsored content, encouraging us to buy more, want more, and never be satisfied with what we have. This can lead to a sense of discontent and unhappiness.
