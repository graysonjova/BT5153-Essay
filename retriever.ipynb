      "      \"essay\": \"Since time immemorial, humanity has been plagued by violence, from the barbaric, ruthless slavery imposed by colonial masters, to the unstable geopolitical scene before us today with war and terror never too far away. Violence exists on a spectrum and can be physical, emotional, or mental, taking many forms such as war, abuse, and bullying. In their formative years, as children are trying to make sense of their identity and the world around them, growing up exposed to violence is particularly pernicious. The world will eventually come to pay the price as children become pawns for extremist groups, significantly more predisposed to violence or apathetic to violence. Children who grow up exposed to violence tend to be more easily swayed by extremist ideologies and often become pawns for terrorist organisations. On one hand, children growing up in war-torn areas tend to be directly exposed to extremist ideology. Having lived in fear and constant instability since young, many children do not view extremist groups as a threat, but rather as their protection from evil that conflict brings. Cognisant of the vulnerability of these children, extremist groups often promise protection from adversaries, the provision of basic necessities, and a sense of community. Many children and youths are hence recruited from war-torn regions to fight for extremist groups. Their constant exposure to violence makes them even more effective as soldiers as their sense of normalcy has been severely warped. During the 2003 Iraq war, the Islamic State (ISIS) found itself incredibly successful in recruiting child soldiers from war-torn Iraq as it promised to fight for Iraq from the invasion of the Americans, and not just food and a place to stay, but also to take care of their families as they fought for ISIS. On the other hand, minorities overseas who are faced with discrimination and violence in their home countries do not feel a sense of belonging and in turn develop a sense of resentment towards their home countries and a desperate need for a sense of community. For many years, ISIS was able to recruit teenage soldiers from Europe, particularly from countries such as France, which were strongly secular and denied the expressions of faith from Muslims which their religion conversely required. This strengthened ISIS\\u2019 presence in the Western world and particularly manipulated child soldiers for roles such as suicide bombers as they tended not to be viewed as threatening to others. As a result, many innocent lives were lost globally and fear gripped many nations as they desperately tried to combat the violent forces of terrorism. Children who grew up exposed to violence in the form of domestic violence or bullying tend to be more predisposed to violence in the future. For decades, psychologists have warned of the harms of abuse and mental health disorders, ranging from mood disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to dissociative personality disorders. Children who grew up exposed to such violence tend to harbor a deep sense of insecurity, anger and fear. It becomes problematic as such violent tendencies fester unchecked through adolescence and these individuals inflict violence upon others as an outlet to cope with their pain and trauma, or simply for revenge. Many notorious serial killers such as Ed Gein, John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy, and Charles all have something in common \\u2013 they were abused as children. According to a Federal Report from the United States Secret Service, the majority of school shooters were victims of bullying in their adolescence. Such violent crimes strike fear internationally as people attempt to grapple with the horrific reality of the depths of darkness that the human mind can possess. Such crimes cause widespread fear as people fear for their safety. While such crimes might be more prevalent in certain countries, it happens in every part of the world. In less extreme cases, such violence causes children to grow up having problems such as trust and abandonment issues, inflicting a similar degree of harm on their own children in the future, causing an unending cycle of hurt and pain, which could lead to deep trauma for many societies in future. Furthermore, as children grow up witnessing violence, apathy towards such violence festers, which could cause social regression in the future. As stories after stories of violence and war are plastered across the news and shared over social media, individuals become desensitised to violence. Children, in particular, become numb to seeing such violence as they have become accustomed to hearing such stories since a young. From the various refugee crises in the mid-2010s, the alleged torture of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, the Burmese military coup, the assassination of Soleimani, the Abu Ghraib tortures in Iraq, to the 2021 Israel-Palestine crisis, children are no stranger to witnessing violence. Particularly with the burgeoning growth of social media, children are exposed to violence at an increasingly young age. Photos of gruesome violence such as lifeless bodies of refugee children washed ashore and corpses with bullet wounds going viral have become common occurrences with every conflict. Such atrocities no longer induce the same level of indignation and moral outrage as fatigue, helplessness, and apathy set in. Psychologists and humanitarians in the United Kingdom lament that the mainstream media is simply no longer able to humanise refugees because of the oversaturation of the media with tragic, violent news, amplifying the apathy amongst the Britons. Given existing trends, there is no telling how much further society will regress in terms of responding to humanitarian crises as apathetic children grow to be leaders of the future. Global humanity will eventually pay the ultimate price for such apathy. Conversely, some may argue that the world, in fact, does not pay the price. Rather, it is the underprivileged communities that will pay the ultimate price for their children to grow up being exposed to violence. For the most extreme cases of violence, the individuals affected most immediately are not the children in the developed West with slight behavioural issues from exposure to violent video games for too long, but the refugee child who suffers intense PTSD from having his homeland bombed, having to flee in boats to other countries only to be turned away or having to see his family torn away from him at refugee centres. The sheer extent of harm is far worse in the poorer, war-torn societies than in richer, privileged parts of the world. While murders and abuse do happen, their impact on society is far less than a war. The fear that arises after a terrorist attack may be imminent, but to live every day in fear for your life is not a gut-wrenching experience most will understand. Even the cost of apathy is paid mostly by the refugees and the oppressed as they fight for their lives. While that may be true, and the price paid is disproportionate, I would posit that the world still pays the price as such underprivileged individuals belong to collective global humanity. The suffering of these individuals is no less a loss to the global community. I would further argue that even though in an absolute sense, the hurt to the privileged parts of the world might be less, but pain and hurt are subjective. The fear that arises in the aftermath of a violent conflict and crisis is rarer, but it impacts people symmetrically as it serves as a painful reminder that nobody is truly safe from the evil of humanity. In the aftermath of the Columbine, Sandy Hook, and Stoneman Douglas High School school shootings, intense grief was felt not only by the communities affected but the entire nation. Following the 2021 River Valley High School murder in Singapore, the fear, confusion, and hurt among the nation was palpable. The suffering of one cannot simply be undermined by being compared to the pain felt by another. All individuals all suffer in various capacities, everyone is paying a price of his or her own, causing the price that is paid to be very much global in nature. Growing up exposed to violence has become a regrettable, but undeniable, aspect of childhood today. Growing up either directly bearing the burden of violence or facing the burden of helplessness when witnessing the globally evident pandemic of violence, our children today will grow up bearing such a weight that they will never be able to shake. And as the world has shown children no mercy and exposed them to this violence, the world will come to pay the ultimate price for its violence.\"\n",

      "      \"essay\": \"Education is often naively thought to be the holy grail of meritocracy. Observers from the outside view the system as a metaphorical social ladder, where all students start at the same point, and their final outcome is a function of only how far they are willing to climb. However, digging below the surface would leave these idealists sorely disillusioned. Underneath the facade of equal competition lies a reality where students are seen not as seeds to grow, but as investments to pump money into so that the rich can secure their status in the upper class. In today\\u2019s world, education is a perpetuator of, not a solution to social inequality. In most societies around the world, financial capital from wealthy students\\u2019 parents gives them a massive leg-up in the educational rat race. This is because even though politicians who preach the value of education in tackling social inequality point to the equality of opportunity provided to students in school, what truly matters is the enrichment that students receive outside the classroom. In Singapore, for example, there is a bustling tuition industry, as parents scramble to find their children an elusive academic edge. In fact, the Straits Times reported that the average Singaporean parent spends $500 every month on tuition or enrichment classes outside of school. These tuition agencies promise excellent academic results, with some even guaranteeing an \\u2018A\\u2019 or \\u2018B\\u2019 grade for their students \\u2013 and they deliver. Such after school programs are also commonplace in other pressure cooker education systems such as South Korea. While $500 a month might seem like a worthy investment for more affluent parents, it forms a large proportion of poorer families\\u2019 household income, entailing a huge opportunity cost that less well-to-do parents simply cannot afford. From this, it is clear that education perpetuates income inequality, rather than enabling social mobility. Unless the education system is restructured in such a way that financial capital does not give students as much of an advantage, education is not and can never be a solution to social inequality. Other than financial capital, students from higher social classes also advantaged by the cultural capital that many of their peers do not have access to. In a survey by the Institute of Policy Studies, researchers found that while more affluent parents treat education as a top priority for their children, it ranks much lower on the list for parents from lower social classes. This is because for these families, the need to attain a good education conflicts with their more basic needs such as caring for younger children and maintaining their financial stability. In tangible terms, this low priority for education manifests in less enriching or stimulating environments devoid of books and educational games that richer students have access to. Poorer parents\\u2019 lower emphasis on education also often translates to their children putting less effort into their school work, making it more difficult for them to do well in school. This insidious source of inequality is nearly omnipresent, deepening the hold of social inequality on poorer families. This situation has become so dire that even America, the country that takes the greatest pride in its meritocracy, has 45% of its Harvard students coming from families earning USD$200,000 a year or more. The fact that students in higher social classes have such a clear advantage in attaining top scores in standardised examinations, proves any claims of education being a solution to social inequality to be nothing more than empty rhetoric. Even when looking beyond the role of individual parents, education can still be said to be a poor solution to social inequality, as there are systemic biases that perpetuate inequality, rather than addressing it. It is true that governments have tried to develop their education systems into true solutions to social inequality. For instance, the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) that American students take at the end of high school takes into account ethnographic factors of students while calculating scores, giving additional points to students that come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Firm believers of education latch onto these examples to propose education as the panacea to social inequality. However, such measures inevitably fall short as they merely target the symptoms of systemic biases; not the root cause. To be a true solution of social inequality, education systems should not base students\\u2019 future opportunities on their past performance, as this prevents substantial improvements from being made. For example, students who are able to enter an elite school after their Primary School Leaving Examinations in Singapore have access to opportunities to stretch their mind, while those studying in neighbourhood schools do not. Similarly, in Finland, students posted to vocational schools have many lower-income jobs cut off from them, regardless of how well they perform in class. This is a problem for the education system as early performance is largely hinged on parental support. It is only when students become older that their academic results become more reflective of their own hard work. This means that education currently judges students largely based on parental factors, leaving students little chance to prove themselves as they get older. Considering this, it is clear that the education system exacerbates social inequality rather than solving it. Overall, it might not be wrong to think of education as a ladder. However, we must be aware that the ladder that each student receives can wildly differ. While come students receive sturdy metal ladders that they can easily scale, others receive shoddy ones with shaky legs and broken rungs. Consequently, it is crucial that the government does not simply throw every child ladder, expecting them to eventually ascend to the same place. The ladder\\u2019s quality is just far too contingent on parents financial and cultural capital, and too inflicted by systematic biases for this to be effective. For the education system to even endeavour to address social inequality, it has to be majorly reformed to stand alone. School should provide additional assistance to lower-income families, before their children enter primary school to negate richer students\\u2019 headstart; more resources should be dedicated to pull-out programmes to reduce the need for tuition; and standardised examinations should be rethought to require more on-the-spot thinking and less drilling. Only then can education truly be a solution to social inequality.\"\n",

      "      \"essay\": \"As Albert Einstein once aptly quipped, \\u201cIt has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.\\u201d Indeed, Science, once founded on the basis of the noble pursuit of truth to benefit mankind, has become increasingly adulterated by the profit-driven motives of research giants all around the world. While some may swear to the notion that it is impossible for Science to exist apart from business, I stand by the view that the commercialisation of Science has destroyed the original intentions behind its development and also led to a host of undesirable ethical issues. For this reason, I believe that as far as possible, Science should not coexist with business.  The coexistence of Science and business has led to the destruction of the original noble intentions behind it, which is to benefit those who need it, the most \\u2013 the poor. However, the profit-driven nature of businesses has caused the latest drugs and technology to be attached to hefty price tags making them impossible for the poor to attain. Genetically modified crops, including pest resistant and vitamin rich produce such as golden rice have been lauded as the most effected panacea to world hunger. However, profit-driven companies such as Monsanto have attached patents to the crops and engineered them to be infertile such that farmers will have to purchase new seeds at the end of each season. This, coupled with the exorbitant prices such crops were marketed at, caused many farmers in India to be mired in huge debt, causing a high number of farmer suicides in India. Another salient example is the sale of antiretroviral drugs for inordinate sums of money, at up to USD900 per month. Given the rapid proliferation of HIV/AIDS in developing countries such as sub-Saharan Africa, this resulted in most being unable to afford the drugs and thus having to go without treatment. Not only does the coexistence of Science and business lead to failure to benefit those in dire need of it, it also results in widening of the rich-poor divide, resulting in polarisation of society. While the rich are able to access treatment to illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, the poor are left to suffer without the aid of such drugs, simply because they are not as well to do. As such, Science should not coexist with business because it fails to achieve its original intentions \\u2013 to benefit those in most dire need of it. The association of science with business have also resulted in a myriad of ethical issues, some of which contravene the very value and dignity of life. In a bid to maximise profits and reduce costs, there have been instances where test objects were coerced and forced to undergo cruel human testing. As human testing is seen as a better research method to obtain more accurate results, there have been instances where scientists have conducted such tests to obtain better test results and hopefully be able to generate more profit in the process. The syphilis experiment in Alabama saw blacks being unknowingly injected with syphilis virus in order for scientists to observe its effects on the human body. Another example is Dr Josef Mengele, the \\u201cAngel of Death\\u201d who conjoined twins and injected dye into prisoner\\u2019s eyes during the war. Though the latter example may have elements of vengeance in it, profit- driven motivations may have also played a part in it. As such, science should not coexist with business lest it results in such unethical behaviour. Furthermore, the commercialisation of science may also result in instances of academic dishonesty. In a bid to acquire the wealth and fame associated with discovering the next blockbuster drug, this may lead scientists to fabricate their scientific experiments and results. Korean scientist and researcher Hwang Woo Suk was granted millions of dollars to conduct stem cell research, only to realise that results were fabricated. Therefore, science should not coexist with business as it encourages and provides an incentive for dishonesty in scientists. However, proponents of the notion that science cannot coexist without business may argue to say that without the objective of profit maximisation, scientists would not be incentivised to continue researching about ways to improve the lives of mankind. After all, money makes the world go round. Furthermore, the commercialisation of science has provided an incentive for scientists to address the most pressing needs of society quickly. In a bid to line their pockets, scientists compete with each other to produce the most effective, cheapest cure to meet the most urgent needs of society. Such competition expedites the pace of research. Hence, the association of science and business has benefitted society by quickly addressing their most pressing needs. However, though the marketing of science has indeed allowed the addressing of society\\u2019s most urgent needs, this has resulted in failure to address areas that are not as promising from the monetary perspective, but nevertheless, as important. The pace of development of antibiotics has slowed down dramatically over the past decades as the profitability of discovering the next antibiotic pales in comparison to discovery of new drugs to treat illnesses such diabetes, which will be required for a lifetime. This, coupled with rapid evolution of bacteria has resulted in a deadly problem\\u2014-antibiotic resistance, which has resulted in a large number of deaths due to inability of antibiotics to overcome these resistant bacteria. However, due to the fact that production of antibiotics is not as profitable, this is a problem, which remains unaddressed. Furthermore, HIV/AIDS, though responsible for over 5000 deaths daily, has not seen tremendous breakthrough in the area of research due to the lack of financial incentives. Clearly, financial incentives is not always accurate indicator of society\\u2019s most pressing issues and should thus not be employed in science. In conclusion, as far as possible, science and business should not be mixed. The commercialisation of science cheapens its pursuit and adulterates the noble intentions it was founded on\\u2014- the pursuit of truth to help mankind. Scientists should instead learn from Physician Edward Jenner, who had a heart of gold and refused to file a patent following his groundbreaking discovery of the smallpox vaccine, saying that it would prevent the poor from gaining access to it. As the saying goes, \\u2018 the love for money is the root of all evil,\\u2019 it is imperative that scientists are not driven by motives of greed and profit maximisation, but by the genuine drive to help others.\"\n",

The man-on-the-street simply cannot understand the material value of a decorative piece of art reserved for the ultra rich while he is struggling to feed his family. Indeed, to the pragmatist, the Arts are simply something inherently useless and irrelevant with little value, and nothing more than an enjoyable pastime and a luxury to the rich. However, as modern world progresses far beyond seeking only economic pursuits, the Arts are increasingly relevant to people across the world as it helps to forge a strong social fabric in our diverse nation, is an increasingly powerful driver of our economy and, most importantly, inculcates important social values in our society.  The Arts have huge economic weight and have become increasingly relevant in society, especially given the rising bourgeois class in Asia and the increasing demand for intellectual discourse. The building of the esplanade has been a prudent investment as the booming arts industry has given Singapore greater international recognition. The arts scene is thus predicted to be the \\u201cHoly Grail\\u201d of the richer market that Singapore is incessantly in search of, while opening art institutes have boosted our economy as well, with up and coming local fashion designers and singers such as J. J. Lin, and even film maker Royston Tan, further enhancing our image and adding to our value as an attractive tourist hotspot, adding to its relevance as it further enhances our nation\\u2019s economic performance.  In our pragmatic and success-driven society, the Arts are also extremely relevant as one of the most powerful mediums to drive across important social values due to its ability to provoke thought and connect deeply with the raw emotions of each individual. The Arts, by portraying human nature and society, have taught us about who we are and what others are like, helping us to understand each other. Kevin Carter\\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of a vulture lying in wait of a starving child in Sudan received much media attention because it brought to attention the desolate situation in third-world countries. This is evidenced by how over hundreds of readers from countries all across the globe, including Singapore, called The New York Times, which published the photograph, after seeing it, to enquire about the fate of the poor child. Their concern thus shows how the photograph was able to speak to people all across the globe in a relevant manner, including Singapore, and propagate important social values such as empathy and compassion towards the less fortunate. Clearly, the Arts force us to think, to question and reflect. Furthermore, literature such as Harper Lee\\u2019s \\u2018To Kill a Mockingbird\\u2019 and Elizabeth George Speare\\u2019s \\u2018The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\u2019 have placed societal issues such as racial discrimination and minority persecution under the spotlight, enabling our understanding of the persecuted, and causing us to question our prejudices, thereby increasing empathy for others who may appear different from ourselves and suffer as a result, while teaching us basic kindness for other human beings. The ability of Arts to criticise, to touch us in places most raw and hidden, has enabled us to understand ourselves and our treatment of others, and in the process, led us to feel and empathise, making it extremely relevant to the masses. As the cosmopolitan city Singaporeans live in become increasingly diverse, the Arts can serve as an important platform for all to better understand each other and build a more cohesive society. In Singapore, although we enjoy relative harmony amongst the races, our collective memory as a young nation-state requires much more building. The \\u201cMosaic model\\u201d the government adopted to serve the national interests of maintaining peace and stability after the 1960s ring hollow when the theory is not backed up with concrete action, such as promotion of cultural interaction of the diverse races through the Arts. Through celebrating the richness of unique art forms, for example, Malay dance and Indian folklore, citizens would gain a better understanding and emerge more unified over time. Our social fabric can only be kept intact if we appreciate and not just tolerate, the beauty of other cultures, through none other than the panoply of activities and products that best express the essence of our heritage \\u2013 the Arts. The Arts has definitely increased in relevance, as it is one of the most effective means of maintaining our delicate social fabric, with our vibrant Arts scene promoting harmony amongst the melting pot of society.  Undoubtedly, the arts market in recent years has witnessed an exponential growth in profits, with major art auction houses such as Christie\\u2019s or Sotheby\\u2019s churning out exorbitant revenues of more than billions each year \\u2013 equivalent to or even greater than the GDP of many impoverished countries. The investment placed in developing the arts, such as constructing theatres and paying for formal artistic training in all fields has spawned critics who view the Arts as nothing more than a luxury reserved for the upper echelons of society, irrelevant to the masses.\\u00a0 Technocrats would argue that it is definitely more prudent to focus on developing the economy and putting more money into scientific research so as to increase our competitiveness in the global arena. Areas such as biotechnology have been pinpointed as the \\u2018next big thing\\u2019 that will affirm Singapore\\u2019s status on the world stage and generate substantial employment, eventually trickling down to improve the wellbeing of everyone. On the other hand, the Arts are but a strain on the nation\\u2019s financial resources and are merely an additional form of entertainment and luxury to the rich, whatever benefits it has to offer unattainable and thus, irrelevant to the masses. However, the Arts cannot be merely seen through the tinted lenses of the obstinate pragmatist who view the Arts as nothing more than a preserve of the rich. In the distant past, the Arts were the special province of the aristocrats and high society, however, in today\\u2019s egalitarian world, the Arts have descended from their ivory tower to the masses. For example, many people can walk into Golden Village or The Cathay and afford a movie for an affordable price of $13. The government has taken advantage of the growing popularity of the Arts by making it more accessible to the masses through means such as affordable dance performances or movie screenings at neighbourhood community centres. The Arts have evidently become increasingly democratized and thus, more relevant to the masses.  The Arts are certainly relevant and effective in reaching out to the masses. Singapore can seek to become an \\u2018artistic hub\\u2019, instead of a mere financial centre labelled by critics as a \\u2018cultural desert\\u2019. As Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong aptly commented, \\u201dMen do not live by bread alone.\\u201d Indeed, it is the Arts that endow us with many perceptive insights and teaches us to find meaning in life hence it should definitely be democratized and made more accessible to the masses.\"\n",

It equips individuals with knowledge and skills to be self-sustaining and independent. It also develops generations of enlightened and socially conscious citizens who work towards achieving success for their nation. However, the structure of formal education has failed to keep up with the rapid changes in technology and advancements in society. This has led\\u00a0 some to question whether education is still a crucial component for a country to thrive. Nevertheless, I believe education is still the key as it imparts important values for social cohesion, inculcates relevant skills for economic progress and empowers people to make positive social change. Detractors may argue that the outdated education system in most countries are ineffective in equipping individuals with the right skills for success. The current education system was designed for the industrial era. Schools have a top-down culture, with a one-size-fits-all curriculum. Cohorts are age-based and students are streamed based on standardised test. The issue with this system is that students are trained to drill context, memorisation and regurgitation of large chunks of information. This can be seen through the extensive syllabus requirements for Cambridge A-levels, as well as lengthy vocabulary lists that students memorise in preparation for SATs. In this digital age, content is less important than context. With an Internet connection, there is a wealth of information right at our fingertips, one click away. It is more important to be able to respond to real life challenges through problem solving skills, analytical skills and inference skills. Little focus is placed on developing these skills and people are left to learn them through their experiences later in life, if they even pick them up. In addition, the emphasis on discipline and rote-memorisation techniques leave little room for innovation. Creativity is stifled as students only hope to attain the \\u201cright\\u201d answer. Schools in Singapore and East Asian countries are known for their rigorous curriculum and high performing students. These education systems produce students who top the Programme for International Student Assessments (PISA) and Trends in International Math and Science Study (Timss) rankings. However, companies from these countries are barely featured in Forbes\\u2019 annual rankings of top countries. This shows that education does not translate to better innovation and better work. The highly regimented education also stifles passion for learning in the students and become passive learners. Instead of being driven and self-directed, they need to be spoon-fed information. Students should instead be taught how to learn. This ineffectiveness of the education system limits its influence on a country\\u2019s success. Education is also not inclusive of all abilities and social-economic status so it is no longer the key to a nation\\u2019s success. There is a global obsession with grades that not only takes a toll on the mental health of students, but also causes a social divide. In the past, the system in Singapore focused on academic credentials based on merit and allowed access to education for all. The meritocratic system enabled those who worked hard to move up the social ladder. This created social cohesion and a sense of purpose. However, Singapore is no longer that fledgling state. Highly stratified and competitive school system has pushed more advantaged families to provide additional support for their child. This includes extra lessons for English, Maths, Mother Tongue, Science, as well as enrichment classes in the fields of sport, performing arts, visual arts. Those who lack the financial means will struggle to catch up. In the US, upper class preschools exist to cater to children of the wealth and are seen to be the first step towards an Ivy-League education. Education is thus biased towards the wealthy. Nearly half of low income students are concentrated in the same schools while students from top schools mostly come from middle to high income backgrounds. Over time, the divide may continue to widen, especially if education is unable to help those students underperforming. The large student to teacher ratio renders inadequate help for social and emotional issues faced, such as dysfunctional families. Full potential of lower performing students is not reached and the income gap cannot be closed. A fragmented and ununited nation may arise as a result. However, many changes are underway to fix the flaws in the education so that it continues to provide a quality education for all and bring success to the nation. Governments in many developed countries have acknowledged the inequality problem and are actively finding solutions. Singapore launched a new inter agency task force called Uplift, short for Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce, to help disadvantaged homes level up. 30% of places at Education ministry-run kindergartens are also being set aside for children from disadvantaged soio-economic backgrounds. Independent schools in Singapore will also lower the fees for lower income families to have greater diversity. Non-profit organisations are also pulling their weight in reducing the education inequality. The South East Community Development Council\\u2019s programme \\u201cLift me, Ah Kor/Ah Jie\\u201d offers mentoring programme to lift students up by helping them deal with their home problems so they can better focus in schools.  Schools are also moving with the times and aligning education better with the needs of the 21st Century. Finland provides a prime example of a revolutionised, modernised education system. They have no standardised tests and a more relaxed atmosphere. Formal education is only compulsory at the age of 9 and class sizes are small. Students have the free time to pursue their own independent learning and pursue their other passions. Teachers also know their students well and can provide them with more support. \\u201cWe prepare children to learn how to learn, not how to take a test,\\u201d said Pasi Sahlberg, a former math and physics teacher who is now in Finland\\u2019s Ministry of Education and Culture. They aim to develop a child holistically, instead of only in grades. Singapore is also making some small, but significant changes to reduce the emphasis on grades. School-based assessments have been removed for primary 1 and 2 students and reduced for upper primary students. PSLE will not have aggregate score but have a wider scoring band to reduce the stress pupils face in trying to chase that final mark, and give them time to develop their interests. Discretionary admission schemes which admit students into schools based on their aptitude in a particular field will also be expanded in the Institute of Technical Education, polytechnics and universities. The syllabus is also changing to cater to more practical skills, by introducing Science Practical Assessments and learning journeys. Students are also being taught more to apply the information they have learnt. Hence, education is changing to stay relevant and will remain key to developing individuals for the nation\\u2019s success. In this highly globalised world, education is also all the more necessary for society to remain harmonious. Globalisation has brought about diversity since people from all over the world are able to meet, whether in real life or virtually. Being global-minded and having collaboration skills are of great importance as they determine the country\\u2019s success. Fostering of a more united community is done through community education where students are taught about different groups of people and learn to be accepting of those different from them. Overseas exchange programmes also widen a students\\u2019 perspective, enabling them to experience things outside their culture and interact with different people. More than 120 out of the 353 primary and secondary schools in Singapore currently offer such exchange programmes. There is also increasing focus on group work, where it is now a tested requirement in project work. Moral education is also a requirement and students are given conduct grades. With terrorism on the rise, often fuelled by the deep-seeded misunderstanding between various peoples within national boundaries and across international boundaries, education is crucial in fostering mutual respect and understanding between different races and cultures. This would settle differences and prevent conflicts. The interconnected and interdependent world is also evolving at a fast rate and education is needed so that a country can stay relevant and progress economically. Many existing jobs will start to disappear as smart machines and lower cost workers take over. It has been estimated that about half of all jobs in the world are at risk of being automated within 5 years. Education upgrades skills of the people so they do not become obsolete. Singapore has launched the Lifelong Learning Institute to encourage workers to continue learning past formal education to polish their skills or pick up new ones. Vocational training in countries such as Germany and Switzerland are education targeted at the job and have led to decreased unemployment, especially for youths, since skills learnt are relevant and directly applicable to their jobs. Basic education also sets the foundation for more scientific and technological advancements to improve the welfare of society. Many cures or vaccines are being developed such as the HIV vaccine that researchers at the University of PittsburghTrusted Source Technology are developing. As Lee Kuan Yew said, \\u201cMy definition of an educated man is a man who never stops learning and wants to learn\\u201d. The continuous learning mindset will be one that enables society to continue progressing and staying relevant. Lastly, education encourages social activism and advocacy. It is through education that there has been gradual demolition of gender prejudices. Benefits to increasing education for females include improved maternal health, reduced infant mortality and fertility rates to increased prevention against HIV and AIDS. Women learn to enact a limit on procreation and learn family planning. Each extra year of a mother\\u2019s schooling reduces the probability of infant mortality by 5-10 per cent. Each additional year of schooling beyond primary also offers greater payoffs for improved opportunities, options and outcomes for girls and women. There will also be greater female labour force participation rates and more productive workforce for the country. Other social injustice still exist such as human trafficking, racial discrimination, honour killings, etc. Education plays an important role in bringing international awareness to these issues. With deeper understanding and insights on them, people in society can devise strategies to deal with them. Education can also allow one to participate in the running of a nation. In a democracy, getting to hear from everyone will benefit the nation. Literacy is necessary in giving individuals the basic right to vote, as well as rough awareness of what is going on. This empowers to oppressed and allow society to progress. In conclusion, as HG Wells puts it, \\u201cHuman history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe.\\u201d Although there may be some flaws in education systems today, it is still imperative that nations be rid of the greatest enemy of progress- ignorance. Education is a big investment that countries are willing to make due to its continued importance in bringing success to a nation through promoting social cohesion, developing the economy and combating social issues. Education needs to be therefore be improved to keep up with the times and be inclusive.\"\n",
