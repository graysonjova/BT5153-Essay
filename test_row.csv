Skyler,Hwa Chong Institution,2021,Do you agree that freedom of speech should never be denied even though it can be abused?,gemma2,"Freedom of speech is really important, like, super duper important.  Everyone should be able to say what they think, right? But sometimes people use their words to hurt other people. Like, imagine if your friend said something mean about you to everyone. That would make you feel bad, wouldn't it?

Some people say that we should never stop anyone from talking, even if what they say is wrong. They say that it's important for people to be able to express themselves freely. But I think it's also important to protect people from being hurt. 

For example, imagine someone spreading rumors about another person online. That could really damage that person's reputation and make their life miserable. Or what if someone uses their words to incite violence? That could lead to real harm and danger.

I think it's important to find a balance between freedom of speech and protecting people from harm. We need to be able to speak our minds, but we also need to be responsible for the words we choose. 

Sometimes, it might be necessary to limit someone's freedom of speech if they are using it to hurt others. It's like when you break a rule at school â€“ sometimes you have to get in trouble so that everyone can stay safe and happy.",25,"Score: 55/100

Explanation:

*   **Content & Information Selection (AO1): 15/30** The essay identifies the core issue of balancing freedom of speech with potential harm. However, the examples are simplistic and lack depth. The essay touches on relevant scenarios (rumors, incitement of violence) but doesn't explore them in detail or consider different types of speech or contexts.

*   **Analysis & Evaluation (AO2): 15/30** The essay presents a basic argument for finding a balance, acknowledging both sides of the issue. However, the analysis is superficial. There's no real critical thinking or exploration of the complexities involved in defining ""harm"" or determining when limitations are justified. The conclusion is weak and doesn't offer a nuanced perspective.

*   **Clarity & Communication (AO3): 15/30** The writing is clear but very informal and simplistic. The register is inappropriate for an academic essay. Vocabulary is limited, and the overall tone is conversational rather than analytical. While the meaning is unambiguous, the lack of sophisticated language detracts from the overall quality.

*   **Structure & Organization (AO4): 10/10** The essay has a basic structure with an introduction, body paragraphs presenting arguments, and a conclusion. The ideas flow logically, and the paragraphing is adequate for the level of analysis.
